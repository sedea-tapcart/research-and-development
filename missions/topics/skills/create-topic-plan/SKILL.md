# Create Topic Plan

Create one root-level topic plan and its sidecar under the selected Sedea operations plan tree. The **topics** mission runs this skill **inline** on the Squad Leader lane (**`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/topics/plan.mdc`** §3). This skill writes planning metadata only; it does not draft delivery phases, PR breakdowns, worktrees, or implementation tasks.

## Inputs

- `topicName`: human-friendly topic name.
- `topicDescription`: concise description for the plan frontmatter `overview` and `## Overview`.
- `objectives`: optional list of high-level objective strings.
- `storageScope`: `user` or `joint`.
- `operationsUserId`: Mission Control supplied operations user id.

## Procedure

1. Validate required inputs:
   - `topicName` and `topicDescription` must be non-empty after trimming.
   - `storageScope` must be exactly `user` or `joint`.
   - `operationsUserId` must be non-empty when `storageScope` is `user`.
2. Resolve output directory (operations checkout; **created on first topic write** when absent):
   - `user` -> `.sedea/operations/<operationsUserId>/plans/roadmap-topics/`
   - `joint` -> `.sedea/operations/joint/plans/roadmap-topics/`
3. Derive the filename stem:
   - Lowercase `topicName`.
   - Replace non-letter and non-digit runs with `_`.
   - Collapse repeated `_` characters.
   - Trim leading and trailing `_` characters.
   - Append `_` plus an 8-character lowercase hex suffix.
4. Create the output directory when absent (`mkdir -p` on the resolved path).
5. Write `<stem>.plan.md`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: <topicName>
   overview: <topicDescription>
   todos: []
   isProject: false
   ---

   # <topicName>

   ## Overview

   <topicDescription>

   ## Objectives

   - <objective>
   ```

   Omit `## Objectives` when `objectives` is empty. Quote YAML scalars when needed so `name` and `overview` parse as strings.
6. Write `<stem>.state.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   # Sidecar for Plan Board (runtime). Plan: <stem>.plan.md
   parent: null
   worktrees: []
   prs: []
   ```

7. Re-read both files and verify:
   - The plan frontmatter includes `name`, `overview`, `todos`, and `isProject`.
   - The plan does not include `Delivery phases`, `PR breakdown`, `Changes`, or `Caveats`.
   - The sidecar has `parent: null`, `worktrees: []`, and `prs: []`.

## Completion (inline)

**Inline-only skill** for the **topics** mission (**`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/topics/plan.mdc`** §3, § *Mission closure*). End the skill portion by reporting these fields in prose on the Squad Leader lane (see **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/4_mission.mdc`** § *Inline completion*). The Squad Leader then runs **`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/topics/plan.mdc`** step 4 and proposes **`MC_DISPATCH_RESOLVED_V1`** when the user closes the dispatch.

| Field | Values | Use |
|-------|--------|-----|
| `creationStatus` | `created` \| `partial` \| `failure` | Skill outcome; step 4 maps to dispatch `status` |
| `planPath` | path | Created `.plan.md` |
| `sidecarPath` | path | Matching `.state.yaml` |
| `storageScope` | `user` \| `joint` | Scope used |
| `topicSlug` | stem | Filename stem without extension |
| `remainingTasks` | strings | `[]` when complete |

Set `creationStatus: created` only when steps 5–7 wrote and verified both files. Set `partial` when validation, collision, or verification blocks completion. Set `failure` when no usable files were written.

## Safety Constraints

- Never overwrite an existing `.plan.md` or `.state.yaml`.
- Never create files outside `.sedea/operations/<operationsUserId>/plans/roadmap-topics/` or `.sedea/operations/joint/plans/roadmap-topics/`.
- Do not create delivery-side sections or implementation artifacts.
