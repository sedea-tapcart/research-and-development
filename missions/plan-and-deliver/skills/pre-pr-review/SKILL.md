# Pre-PR Review

**Spawn-only (binding).** Run on a **fresh spawned child lane** opened by **`mission_control_spawn_agent`** from **`coding-session`**. Mission Control validates frontmatter **`inputs`** at spawn time. **Forbidden:** execute this skill **inline** on the **`coding-session`** lane — mirror [`create-pr/SKILL.md`](../create-pr/SKILL.md) (inline-only on **`coding-session`**; **`pre-pr-review`** is the inverse: spawn-only from that lane).

### Standalone dispatch (stop immediately)

If Mission Control opened a session whose only intent is **`pre-pr-review`** / pre-PR review with **no** spawn handover from active **`coding-session`** (`worktreePath`, `worktreeName`, `baseRef`, committed diff):

1. **Stop** — do not run review steps.
2. Tell the developer **`pre-pr-review`** is **spawn-only** — a fresh child lane from **`coding-session`** after ship cut-point + Before deploy.
3. Direct them to open or return to **`coding-session`** and complete the ship chain through [Auto-spawn pre-pr-review](../coding-session/SKILL.md#auto-spawn-pre-pr-review).

## Warm-up manifest (spawned)

Per [`.sedea/centers/sedea/docs/lane-manifest-contract.md`](.sedea/centers/sedea/docs/lane-manifest-contract.md) and **`../README.md`** § *Default warm-up* / *Warm-up cap exceptions*. Host merge: `effectiveWarmUp = dedupe(bootstrapRules → laneRules → skillWarmUp)`. Frontmatter matches this table. **384 KiB cap:** frontmatter omits **`plan.mdc`** and **`development-process.md`** — Step 3 reads **`development-process.md`**; Step 4 loads **`inputs.targetPlanPath`** (PR plan, not Squad Leader **`plan.mdc`**). **No `alwaysApply` frontmatter flip.**

### `bootstrapRules` — host-resolved (R&D layer)

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/rules/bootstrap.mdc` | Sole R&D `alwaysApply: true` bootstrap (≤10 KB); host merges when `centerSlug === research-and-development` |

### `skillWarmUp` — frontmatter `warmUpRules`

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/skills/README.md` | Spawn contracts, terminal stop |
| `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc` | Review-before-PR, worktree ownership |
| `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/rules/30_planning-target-resolution.mdc` | Plan anchor validation (spawn-only) |

### `laneRules` — frontmatter `laneRules`

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc` | Structured choice when this lane must surface a pick |
| `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc` | Ship lane context |
| `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/skills/pre-pr-review/SKILL.md` | This skill procedure |
| `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/skills/README.md` | Spawn preflight |

**Who runs this:** a fresh **pre-PR reviewer agent** lane spawned by **`coding-session`** after developer implementation approval, **commit**, and inline **Local test** **`deploy-walk`** (or documented skip). The reviewer must have no carry-over from the coding agent that changed the worktree.

This pass complements, and does not replace, the later GitHub-surface **reviewer agent**.

**Worktree removal ownership (binding).** **Do not remove worktrees you do not own.** Review **`worktreePath`** only — this skill does **not** authorize **`git worktree remove`**, **`git worktree prune`**, or **`sedea_remove_worktree_folder`** except on **this pass’s** **`WORKTREE_ROOT`** when **all four** preconditions in [`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/0_hosting-repo.mdc`](.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/0_hosting-repo.mdc) § *Worktree ownership* and rule **20** § *Worktree removal ownership (binding)* hold. **`git worktree list` is read-only** when ownership is unclear — **stop; do not remove**.

## Agent messaging (MCP)

**MCP spawn/result skill.** Parent→child spawn and child terminal result use MCP tools per **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/4_mission.mdc`** § *Agent-to-agent spawn protocol*.

| Action | MCP tool |
|--------|----------|
| Parent spawn (when this skill emits a child lane) | **`mission_control_spawn_agent`** |
| **This** spawned lane terminal (and terminal re-emits) | **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** |

**Binding:**

- Run **`../README.md`** § *MCP spawn preflight* (rows M1–M8) before every MCP spawn; **forbidden** host-resolved identity keys in MCP args (`correlationId`, `dispatchId`, `slotId`, … — see README § *Host-resolved identity*).
- Inline skills on this mission stay **inline-only** — no spawn wire change unless the protocol step explicitly spawns a child lane.


## Structured choice (Mission Control)

This skill does not own approval modals — **`coding-session`** collects developer consent before spawns. When this lane must surface a pick, use **AskQuestion**, **`mission_control_present_structured_choice`** per **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc`** and **`../README.md`** § *Recap, structured choice, act*.

## Checkpoint turn UX (skill-local)

Under Checkpoint trust (`trustLevel: checkpoint`), auto-advance scripted happy-path steps; emit structured choice only at **USER_CHECKPOINT** markers in this section, implicit external-wait surfaces, or exception paths. **No cross-skill inheritance** — gate defaults here apply only to **`pre-pr-review`**; invoker missions **`plan-and-deliver`**, **`single-phase`**, **`quick-fix`**, and **`debug-and-fix`** document their own **`coding-session`** ship gates — see **`coding-session/SKILL.md`** § *Checkpoint turn UX* for Review feedback approval and Create-PR handoff.

**Real-dispatch test loop (binding):** After merge, run one full **`pre-pr-review`** spawn on a Checkpoint dispatch through Step **8** — verify Steps **1–7** auto-advance and Step **8** **always** auto-emits terminal + parent refocus (including **`no-go`**) without a modal; the **`coding-session`** parent receives the bubble-up and owns next-step gates before the parent phase advances the next ship-chain skill PR — per **Phase 2 — R&D center audit** § *Single-concern strategy*.

Marker syntax: [`.sedea/centers/sedea/docs/user-checkpoint-marker-syntax.md`](.sedea/centers/sedea/docs/user-checkpoint-marker-syntax.md).

| Step | Checkpoint behavior | Gate |
|------|---------------------|------|
| **1** — Validate spawned inputs | Auto-advance on valid spawn `inputs` | exception: missing required inputs → `failure` terminal |
| **Refresh lane display** | Auto-advance when labels match; act when stale | — |
| **2** — Fresh reviewer lane | Auto-advance on clean detached lane | exception: reused coding-agent context → `aborted` |
| **3** — Load standards and rules | Auto-advance | exception: missing required rule → `partial` |
| **4** — Load anchor | Auto-advance | exception: wrong plan template → `failure` |
| **5** — Read committed diff | Auto-advance against committed cut point | exception: zero commits / empty diff → `failure` |
| **6** — Score categories | Auto-advance through category table | — |
| **7** — Proposed follow-ups | Auto-advance (handoff only; no plan mutation) | — |
| **8** — Report and result | Auto-advance — report, parent refocus, terminal same turn (all outcomes including **`no-go`**) | — |

### Developer input vs external-wait (Checkpoint)

Under Checkpoint trust, **happy-path** reviewer steps (**1–8**) **auto-advance without a turn-end modal** on this lane. This skill owns **no** developer-input **`USER_CHECKPOINT`** markers — **`coding-session`** owns Review feedback approval, Create-PR handoff (exceptional), and post-create-pr gates after terminal bubble-up.

**Forbidden on this lane:** prose-only report handback without **`mission_control_send_agent_result`**; **`mission_control_present_structured_choice`** / AskQuestion at Step **8** (including **`no-go`**); *tell me when*, *waiting for developer*, or *stay advisory until you pick* — parent lane gates apply after **`mission_control_refocus_parent_lane`**.

**Exception paths** (missing inputs, wrong anchor, empty diff, reused coding-agent context) emit **`failure`** / **`aborted`** / **`partial`** terminal results — not developer-choice modals on this reviewer lane.

## Session orientation table (binding)

Give developers a **consistent state snapshot** during pre-PR review so they can re-orient after reload or parallel work.

**When required:** At spawn bootstrap gates only — **not** at Step **8** under Checkpoint (Step **8** auto-advances). Render as the **first block** in `displayMarkdown` when a gate applies. **Forbidden:** omitting the table and substituting scattered one-liners on modal gates. The terminal **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** line uses the 1–3 sentence `summary` only — do **not** embed the markdown table in the terminal JSON.

**Table shape (markdown):**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Plan | `<slug>` @ `<path>` or — (free-form: —) |
| Worktree | `<worktreePath>` from spawn inputs |
| Branch | `<worktreeName>` from spawn inputs |
| PR | — (pre-PR — no open PR yet) |
| Ship phase | `pre-pr-review` |
| Deploy scope | Local test complete · skipped · — |
| Review | in progress · `go` · `no-go` when reporting |

**Population rules:** Same contract as [`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/skills/coding-session/SKILL.md`](../coding-session/SKILL.md) § *Session orientation table (binding)* — use spawn `inputs` and review outputs; never invent paths.

**Mandatory gates (this skill):** None at Step **8** under Checkpoint — the reviewer lane always auto-handbacks; **`coding-session`** owns developer gates for **`no-go`**, flags, and actionable handback (see [Step 8 — Report and result](#step-8--report-and-result)).

## Step 1 — Validate spawned inputs

Required inputs:

1. `anchorType`: `plan` or `free-form`.
2. `worktreePath`: absolute worktree path.
3. `worktreeName`: worktree name being reviewed.
4. `baseRef`: remote base ref, usually `origin/main`.

For `anchorType: "plan"`, `targetPlanPath` is required and must point to a per-PR plan. If the file is a Master Plan or Phase plan, stop with `failure`; this review requires the PR plan that owns the implementation scope.

If any required input is missing, stop with `failure`. Do not ask the developer to reconstruct a seed; the spawning `coding-session` agent owns input assembly.

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance to [Refresh lane display](#refresh-lane-display-when-stale) when validation passes — no `USER_CHECKPOINT` on happy-path spawn handoff. On missing required inputs, emit `failure` terminal — not a missing-inputs modal on this lane.

## Refresh lane display (when stale)

After **`targetPlanSlug`** or free-form scope is validated (end of Step 1):

1. Compare the visible tab **title** / **hover** to this review pass (plan slug, worktree name, or scope summary).
2. When spawn labels are **generic or wrong**, call MCP **`mission_control_update_lane_display`** on **this lane only** with **`title`** = `Pre-PR Review-{semantic title}` (**`targetPlanSlug`**, worktree name, or scope summary) and optional **`description`** / **`hoverDescription`** (max lengths in [`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/9_display-metadata-authority.mdc`](.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/9_display-metadata-authority.mdc)). See [rule **50**](../../../../rules/50_mission-control-display-metadata-discipline.mdc) § *Lane title prefix conventions*.
3. **Skip** when spawn labels already match scope.
4. **Forbidden:** **`mission_control_update_dispatch_display`** from a child lane.

See [`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/rules/50_mission-control-display-metadata-discipline.mdc`](../../../../rules/50_mission-control-display-metadata-discipline.mdc) § *Child lane — refresh own slot when labels are stale*.

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance to Step **2** after display refresh or skip — no `USER_CHECKPOINT` on this step.

## Step 2 — Fresh reviewer lane

Confirm this is a fresh reviewer lane. Do not reuse context from the coding agent that implemented the worktree. If the lane already contains implementation edits or coding-agent tool history, stop with `aborted` and request a fresh `pre-pr-review` spawn.

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance to Step **3** on a clean detached lane — no `USER_CHECKPOINT` on this step.

## Step 3 — Load standards and rules

Read `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/docs/development-process.md` in full, or at minimum the per-PR template, strategy, cadence, and Pre-PR reviewer sections.

Read every path from `projectRules`. If a rule path is missing, report it as `partial` unless the rule is clearly irrelevant to the diff.

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance to Step **4** — no `USER_CHECKPOINT` on this step.

## Step 4 — Load anchor

- `plan`: read `targetPlanPath`. Verify per-PR template sections §§ 1–7 are present; § 8 and `## Follow-ups` are optional. Do not mutate §§ 1–8.
- `free-form`: no plan file; review the committed diff only.

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance to Step **5** when anchor loads — no `USER_CHECKPOINT` on this step. Wrong plan template → `failure` terminal.

## Step 5 — Read committed diff

From `worktreePath`, inspect:

```bash
git fetch origin
git diff --stat <baseRef>...HEAD
git log --oneline <baseRef>..HEAD
git diff <baseRef>...HEAD
git status --short
git status --short --ignore-submodules=dirty
```

If `git status --short` is non-empty, continue against the committed diff but evaluate dirty-tree degradation using `git status --short --ignore-submodules=dirty` (aligns with `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc` submodule-only drift guidance). Only non-submodule local edits should be flagged as not part of the reviewed cut point.

If there are zero commits ahead and no diff, stop with `failure`: there is nothing to review.

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance to Step **6** when a committed diff exists — no `USER_CHECKPOINT` on this step.

## Pre-PR phase boundary (plan anchor)

This skill runs **before** the PR is opened or merged. Scope is **pre-merge readiness** — not production deploy verification.

| Plan section | Pre-PR scope | Owner after merge |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| §§ **1–6**, § **8** | In scope for scoring and follow-ups | — |
| § **7** `### Local test` | In scope — verify against diff / § 6 tests (legacy **`### Local test`**) | **`coding-session`** runs **`deploy-walk`** inline (`local-test-only`) before this review |
| § **7** `### Staging test` | **Out of scope** — omit from the entire pre-PR report (see below) | **`deploy-walk`** after PR open (**development-process.md** § *Ship chain*) |
| § **7** `### Production` | **Out of scope** — omit from the entire pre-PR report (see below) | **`deploy-walk`** after merge (**development-process.md** § *Ship chain*) |

### §7 Staging test and Production — silent omission (binding)

**`### Staging test`** and **`### Production`** are **not** pre-PR reviewer scope. This pass does **not** score them and does **not** mention them anywhere in output — including under **`Defer`**, flags, blockers, proposed follow-ups, category **G** narrative, chat recap, `outputs.codingAgentHandback`, or the terminal `summary`.

Do **not** report (and do **not** echo for awareness):

- Unchecked **`[ ]`** lines under **`### Staging test`** or **`### Production`**.
- Missing execution of staging or production deploy steps before the PR exists.
- Requests to complete **Staging test** or **Production** before PR.
- Summary bullets such as *Post-merge production smoke via deploy-walk; not a pre-PR gate* or tags like **`[G §7 Production — post-merge]`**.

If the only “deferred” work you would list is staging or post-merge deploy verification, **omit the `Defer` group entirely** from the report and leave `codingAgentHandback.Defer` empty (or omit the key).

### §7 Local test — scoring

- **`PASS`** when every Local test item is satisfied by the diff, § 6 tests, or an explicit *None — …* line in the plan.
- **`FLAG`** only for Local test gaps that are **merge-blocking** (missing PR-specific verification not covered by § 6 or standing CI).
- **`FAIL`** only when a Local test gap would make opening the PR unsafe **now** — never because Staging test or Production is still `[ ]`.

## Step 6 — Score categories

Verdict per row: `PASS`, `FLAG`, or `FAIL`. `FAIL` blocks PR creation or merge readiness.

### Plan anchor categories

| Cat | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| **A** | § 1 Single concern vs diff scope |
| **B** | § 2 Background clarity |
| **C** | § 3 Change scope vs diff |
| **D** | § 4 Reasoning quality |
| **E** | § 5 Repo rules impact |
| **F** | § 6 Tests to write |
| **G** | § 7 Deploy test plan — **`### Local test` only** (see [Pre-PR phase boundary](#pre-pr-phase-boundary-plan-anchor)); Staging test and Production are post–create-pr / post-merge |
| **H** | § 8 Caveats vs surprises |
| **I** | Repo-rule compliance |
| **J** | General code quality |

### Free-form categories

| Cat | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| **F1** | Single concern |
| **F2** | Repo-rule compliance |
| **F3** | General code quality |

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance to Step **7** after category scoring — no `USER_CHECKPOINT` on this step.

## Step 7 — Proposed follow-ups

For `plan` anchor only: collect actionable `FLAG` items that are not blockers as **proposed** `## Follow-ups` for the PR plan. Do **not** mutate the plan file from this reviewer lane; the active **`coding-session`** agent must present these proposed follow-ups to the developer and receive explicit approval before appending them.

Rules:

1. One sentence per bullet.
2. Prefix with bracketed category tag, e.g. `[C § 3]`.
3. Add optional `(target: ...)` routing hints.
4. Do not append `FAIL` items; blockers stay in the report.
5. Return proposed follow-ups in `outputs.proposedFollowUps`; leave `outputs.followUpsAppended` empty unless the invocation context explicitly includes prior developer approval for this exact mutation.
6. **Exclude** every item that only restates **`### Staging test`**, **`### Production`**, or post-merge production verification — omit entirely (see **§7 Staging test and Production — silent omission** above), not in `proposedFollowUps` or handback.

For `free-form`, skip file writes.

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance to Step **8** — handoff only; no plan mutation and no `USER_CHECKPOINT` on this step.

## Step 8 — Report and result

Report:

1. Category table.
2. Blockers (`FAIL`).
3. Flags.
4. Recommendation: `go` only when there are no `FAIL` rows.
5. Coding-agent handback: what to fix next, with **`Must`** and **`Should`** groups when non-empty. Apply [Pre-PR phase boundary](#pre-pr-phase-boundary-plan-anchor):
 - **`Must`** — merge-blocking `FAIL` rows and true pre-merge gaps only.
 - **`Should`** — pre-merge improvements only.
 - **`Defer`** — **do not use** for **`### Staging test`**, **`### Production`**, **`deploy-walk`**, or post-merge production smoke (see **§7 Staging test and Production — silent omission** above). Include **`Defer`** only for other genuinely deferred pre-PR-adjacent items; if none, omit the **`Defer`** section and do not populate staging/post-merge deploy bullets in `outputs.codingAgentHandback`.
6. **Deploy test plan (§7):** when the developer reported manual §7 smoke during review, list which numbered **`### Local test`** steps they said passed — the coding agent should flip those lines in `targetPlanPath` only after the developer **confirms each step** in session (see **`coding-session`** § *Deploy test plan confirmations*). Do **not** mention **`### Staging test`** or **`### Production`** in this pass. This reviewer skill does **not** append `[x]` without that per-step confirmation.

The handback is advisory until the developer approves the fix pass. Do not frame reviewer feedback as automatic authorization for **`coding-session`** to edit code. The coding agent must present the review result to the developer, **recommend** addressing relevant findings when **`actionablePrePrFindings`** applies, and open its **Review feedback approval gate** (including **Implement pre-PR review findings now (this session)** as the first option — **even when** `recommendation` is `go` but `flags` or **Must** / **Should** handback remain) before applying fixes or proceeding to Create-PR.

End with a child result containing:

- `outputs.anchorType`
- `outputs.targetPlanPath`
- `outputs.targetPlanSlug`
- `outputs.worktreePath`
- `outputs.worktreeName`
- `outputs.baseRef`
- `outputs.recommendation` (`go` | `no-go`)
- `outputs.blockers`
- `outputs.flags`
- `outputs.proposedFollowUps`
- `outputs.followUpsAppended`
- `outputs.codingAgentHandback`
- `outputs.requiresDeveloperApproval`
- `outputs.activeLanes`
- `outputs.openLedgerEntries`
- `outputs.remainingTasks`
- `outputs.continuationOwner: "pre-pr-review-agent"`
- `outputs.continuationStatus`

Set `continuationStatus`:

- `terminal` when the review report is complete — including **`no-go`** (parent owns fix-loop gates; this lane does not wait on the developer).
- `partial` status with `continuationStatus: "active"` when the review ran but missing rules, non-submodule dirty uncommitted edits, or incomplete anchors make the result degraded.

After the report, hand back per **Squad Leader bubble-up** below. Do not run `git`, `gh`, source edits, commits, pushes, or PR creation.

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance through Steps **1–8** on the happy path — **no** `USER_CHECKPOINT` on Step **8**. **`no-go`** is a recommendation for the parent lane, not a reviewer-lane pause.

## Squad Leader bubble-up (detached lanes)

Runs on a **detached** reviewer lane; the **plan and deliver** Squad Leader may not see this result until terminal **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** host sync.

### Auto terminal + parent refocus (binding — all outcomes)

After Step **8** report completes ( **`go`** or **`no-go`** ):

**Same turn** (report prose may precede MCP structured-choice call):

1. Call **`mission_control_refocus_parent_lane`** (optional `{ "reason": "pre-pr-review-complete" }` — no host-resolved identity keys).
2. Emit terminal **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** as the **last line** per [Completion (spawned)](#completion-spawned).

Populate terminal **`outputs`** with full review result — including **`recommendation: no-go`**, **`blockers`**, **`flags`**, and **`codingAgentHandback`** when present. The **parent** (**`coding-session`**) opens **Review feedback approval gate** or blocks Create-PR per its skill; this reviewer lane does **not** pause for developer confirmation.

**Forbidden at Step 8:** **`mission_control_present_structured_choice`** / AskQuestion report/result modal; **`USER_CHECKPOINT`** at Step **8**; waiting for **`review-lane-done`**; prose-only handback without MCP result.

§8 progress reaches the Squad Leader via **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** terminal **`outputs`** (`targetPlanPath`, `shipPhase`, `rowStatus`) and Mission Control host sync — **not** developer paste on the leader dispatch (**`../../plan.mdc`** §8 *Policy — no manual recap*).

| Outcome | `shipPhase` | `rowStatus` | Key `outputs` |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `recommendation: go` | `pre-pr-review` | `open` | `targetPlanPath`, `remainingTasks` |
| `no-go` / blockers | `pre-pr-review` | `blocked` | `targetPlanPath`, `blockers`, `blockedReason` in recap |

## Mission Control section 8 sync (required terminal `outputs`)

On **every** terminal `mission_control_send_agent_result` (including follow-up re-emits), `outputs` **must** include:

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `targetPlanPath` | Absolute PR plan `.plan.md` path — **required**; host skips ledger sync without it |
| `shipPhase` | From the bubble-up table row for this terminal (`pre-pr-review` typical) |
| `rowStatus` | `open` when `recommendation: go`; `blocked` when `no-go` or blockers remain |
| `remainingTasks` | When `rowStatus` is not `closed` |
| `blockedReason` | When `rowStatus` is `blocked` (summarize blockers) |

Mission Control writes `ship-ledger.v1.json` from child terminal **`outputs`** and may inject **Ship recap — plan and deliver** on the Squad Leader lane. Manual **Ship recap** paste on the leader dispatch is **forbidden** per **`../../plan.mdc`** §8 *Policy — no manual recap*; when host sync did not run, fix terminal **`outputs`** or route to **mission completeness triage** — do not nudge paste workaround.

## Completion (spawned)

Required `outputs` per **Step 8 — Report and result**, **Mission Control section 8 sync**, and the bubble-up table. Re-emit an **updated** terminal result after user-requested follow-up on this lane (same `correlationId`).

### Parent refocus (binding)

On every successful Step **8** auto-handback, call **`mission_control_refocus_parent_lane`** **immediately before** the MCP result call so Mission Control focuses the **immediate parent** lane (typically **`coding-session`**) in the same dispatch. See **`.sedea/centers/sedea/skills/README.md`** § *Optional parent refocus (`mission_control_refocus_parent_lane`)*.

| Path | Refocus |
|------|---------|
| Step **8** complete (**`go`** or **`no-go`**) | **`mission_control_refocus_parent_lane`** same turn, before terminal |
| **`failure`** / **`aborted`** terminal without bubble-up | Omit refocus unless skill text requires parent attention |

**Forbidden:** structured-choice options whose primary purpose is parent-switch — use **`mission_control_refocus_parent_lane`** instead.

### MCP result preflight (`mission_control_send_agent_result`)

| Step | Check |
|------|--------|
| R1 | Call **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** with **`status`**, **`summary`**, optional **`outputs`** / **`errors`** |
| R2 | **Forbidden args absent** — no **`correlationId`**, **`dispatchId`**, **`slotId`**, or other host-resolved keys |
| R3 | Populate **`outputs`** from the required field list below |
| R4 | Re-emit updated MCP result after user-requested follow-up on this lane (same spawn session; host resolves **`correlationId`**) |

**Message order on terminal turns:** report recap (optional prose) → **`mission_control_refocus_parent_lane`** (when required above) → **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** (**last line**).

Stop after the MCP result call. Do not emit another `mission_control_spawn_agent` or run the next protocol step in the same turn (see **`../README.md`** § *Terminal stop (normative)*).

## Completion (inline)

Report the fields below in prose to the invoker on the **same lane**. Do **not** emit `mission_control_spawn_agent`, `mission_control_send_agent_result`, or `mission_control_propose_dispatch_resolution`. Do **not** add a **MCP result** under this section (see **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/4_mission.mdc`** § *Inline completion* and **`.sedea/centers/sedea/skills/README.md`** § *Completion (inline)*).

**Forbidden when `upstreamSkill` is `coding-session`:** do **not** run inline on the **`coding-session`** lane — spawn only per **Spawn-only (binding)** above.

When a mission protocol **explicitly** assigns this skill inline on a **non–`coding-session`** lane (rare), use the same `outputs` semantics as **Step 8 — Report and result** and **`## Completion (spawned)`** in prose only — **no** spawn or MCP results.
