 no warmUpRules. Agent-executable steps run without approval; manual steps print
 numbered step-by-step testing instructions for the developer. Three-state lifecycle
 in `**Status:**`; capstone todo when done.

# Deploy walk-through

**Lane requirement (no separate warm-up).** This skill has **no** frontmatter **`warmUpRules`** by design. Run it **only** on the active **`coding-session`** lane after that session has loaded ship rules (**`20_efficient-pr-shipping`**, **`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/plan.mdc`**, **`skills/README.md`**, dev-process). Do **not** start a standalone Mission Control session on **`deploy-walk`** alone — context will be incomplete.

### Standalone dispatch (stop immediately)

If Mission Control opened a session whose only intent is **`deploy-walk`** / deploy verification with **no** active **`coding-session`** context (`worktreePath`, `targetPlanPath` when plan-anchored):

1. **Stop** — do not walk checklists or edit the plan.
2. Tell the developer **`deploy-walk`** is **inline-only** on the **`coding-session`** lane (Local test after commit, Staging test after PR open, After deploy after merge, or deploy phrases on that lane).
3. Direct them to open or return to **`coding-session`** with the PR plan and worktree — see [`coding-session/SKILL.md`](../coding-session/SKILL.md) § *Local test deploy-walk handoff*, § *Staging test deploy-walk handoff*, and § *After deploy deploy-walk handoff*.

**Execution owner:** the active **coding-session agent** runs this skill inline. Do **not** spawn a separate deploy-walk child lane.

**Agent-executable** steps (tests, repo scripts, curl/log checks the agent can run in the worktree or with available env) run **without approval** — on pass, flip `[ ]` → `[x]` with a dated note and advance. **Manual** steps are presented with numbered **Testing steps** the developer follows in order (verbatim plan text, rationale, expected outcome, expanded commands); the agent assists until the developer confirms, then flips the box. Three-state lifecycle (`drafted` → `deployed` → `done`) is recorded in a `**Status:**` line at the top of § N. When Status reaches `done`, frontmatter todo `deploy-test-plan-verified` flips `pending` → `done` in the same turn (see *Frontmatter capstone*). **Cross-skill:** when **`coding-session`** receives ad-hoc “step *N* confirmed” for §7, it must apply the same plan-file update rules here — or the developer should invoke **`deploy-walk <N> done`**. Use when the user says `deploy-walk present <N>`, `deploy-walk <N> done [: <note>]`, `deploy-walk <N> skip: <reason>`, `deploy-walk <N> block: <reason>`, `deploy-walk deployed [: <note>]`, or `deploy-walk status` **on the coding-session lane**.

| Step kind | Who runs it | On success |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Agent-executable** | **Coding-session agent** (inline deploy-walk) — no approval modal before run | Agent runs commands, flips `[ ]` → `[x]` with dated note (command + outcome), advances to the next step |
| **Manual** | **Developer** — agent prints numbered **Testing steps** and assists | Developer reports; agent flips on `deploy-walk <N> done` / skip / block |

See [Agent-executable vs manual steps](#agent-executable-vs-manual-steps).

**Worktree removal ownership (binding).** **Do not remove worktrees you do not own.** Deploy verification may read **`worktreePath`**; post-merge cleanup removes **only** **this pass’s** **`WORKTREE_ROOT`** after merge consent — see [`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/0_hosting-repo.mdc`](.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/0_hosting-repo.mdc) § *Worktree ownership* and rule **20** § *Worktree removal ownership (binding)*. **`git worktree list` is read-only** when ownership is unclear — **stop; do not remove**.

## Structured choice (Mission Control)

Target picks, deploy-with-gaps, and closure gates use **AskQuestion** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** per **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc`** and **`../README.md`** § *Recap, structured choice, act* — recap + modal in **one turn** when practical; rule **2** priority **3** split only when a long recap was already sent. **Act** (checkbox flips, status lines) follows developer selection or explicit deploy-walk commands.

When run **inline** on **`coding-session`** (pre-merge **Local test**, post–create-pr **Staging test**, or post-merge **After deploy**), this procedure owns deploy verification status and reports it via **`## Completion (inline)`** to the coding-session agent; it does not run implementation, PR review, or plan reconciliation.

## Not chained to `plan-reconcile`

**This skill never invokes `plan-reconcile`.** Capstone todo **`deploy-test-plan-verified`** → `done` closes the **deploy checklist only** — not archive, not parent-plan reconcile.

| Agent mistake | Correct action |
|---------------|----------------|
| Treat deploy walk `done` as permission to archive the plan | Tell the developer to run **`plan-reconcile`** inline on **`coding-session`** when ready (phrase or stale-worktree / post-deploy choice) |
| Emit **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** for **`plan-reconcile`** from this lane | **Forbidden** — hand off in prose only |

Canonical: **`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc`** § *deploy-walk vs plan-reconcile (not chained)*.

## Entry points

Canonical table: **`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/docs/development-process.md`** § *Ship chain* → **`deploy-walk` entry points**.

| How it starts | Lane |
|---------------|------|
| Developer phrase (`deploy-walk present <N>`, status, done/skip/block) on active **`coding-session`** | Inline on **`coding-session`** |
| **`coding-session`** after implementation approval + commit — Local test only | Inline (`upstreamSkill: coding-session`, `deployWalkScope: local-test-only`) |
| **`coding-session`** after PR open — Staging test only | Inline (`upstreamSkill: coding-session`, `deployWalkScope: staging-test-only`) |
| **`coding-session`** After deploy — developer chooses **PR merged — start After deploy deploy-walk** at post-create-pr gate | Inline (`upstreamSkill: coding-session`) — full §7 walk |
| Detached phrase / direct skill dispatch without **`coding-session`** | **Stop** — redirect to **`coding-session`** (see *Standalone dispatch*) |

**Pre-merge vs post-merge:** **`coding-session`** runs **Local test** while `**Status:**` is `drafted` (pre-PR). After **`create-pr`**, flip to `pr-open` and run **Staging test** before merge. **`coding-session`** (post-merge gate) owns **After deploy** and the `deployed → done` lifecycle. Completing any walk does **not** start **`plan-reconcile`** — reconcile is a separate developer or **`coding-session`** follow-on when merge/archive triage is needed.

## Inline on coding-session (`local-test-only`)

When `upstreamSkill` is **`coding-session`** and `deployWalkScope` is **`local-test-only`** (legacy alias **`before-deploy-only`**):

| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Scope** | Only **`### Local test`** numbered steps while `**Status:**` is `drafted` (legacy **`### Before deploy`** reads as Local test) |
| **Forbidden** | `deploy-walk pr-open`, `deploy-walk deployed`, or walking **`### Staging test`** / **`### After deploy`** |
| **Forbidden** | **Frontmatter capstone** `deploy-test-plan-verified` → `done` (full checklist not complete pre-merge) |
| **Terminal** | `localTestStatus: complete`; `deployStatus: drafted` (unchanged); `stagingTestStatus` / `afterDeployStatus: incomplete` or `unknown` — hand back to **`coding-session`** for [Auto-spawn pre-pr-review](../coding-session/SKILL.md#auto-spawn-pre-pr-review) |
| **Blocked** | Any Local-test step remains `[ ]` without skip/block resolution → report `blockedStep` in inline outputs |
| **Handback** | Parent **`coding-session`** continues to [Auto-spawn pre-pr-review](../coding-session/SKILL.md#auto-spawn-pre-pr-review) — not **`create-pr`** |

## Inline on coding-session (`staging-test-only`)

When `upstreamSkill` is **`coding-session`** and `deployWalkScope` is **`staging-test-only`**:

| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Scope** | Only **`### Staging test`** numbered steps while `**Status:**` is `pr-open` |
| **Forbidden** | `deploy-walk deployed` (no `pr-open → deployed` flip until merge) |
| **Forbidden** | Walking **`### Local test`** or **`### After deploy`** in this scope |
| **Terminal** | `stagingTestStatus: complete`; `deployStatus: pr-open` (unchanged) — hand back to **`coding-session`** for pr-review or post-create-pr gate |
| **Blocked** | Any Staging-test step remains `[ ]` without skip/block resolution → report `blockedStep` in inline outputs |
| **Handback** | Parent **`coding-session`** continues ship chain (typically [Inline PR review](../coding-session/SKILL.md#inline-pr-review-after-pr-creation) or post-create-pr gate) |

Use `worktreePath` / `worktreeName` from inline context for command context in step presentations. PR fields (`prUrl`, `prNumber`, …) are usually present for staging scope.

## Worktree path visibility (binding)

When **`worktreePath`** is set on inline context (typical on **`coding-session`** Before deploy while the session worktree still exists):

| Surface | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Manual step presentation** ([Step 4](#step-4--step-presentation-contract)) | First line after the plan header: **`Worktree: <absolute-worktreePath>`** |
| **Agent-executable run** | Recap **`cwd: <absolute-worktreePath>`** before shell commands |
| **Developer-await gates** ([Deploy developer-await modal options](#deploy-developer-await-modal-options-binding)) | **`display.markdown`** includes **`Worktree: <absolute-worktreePath>`** when any step runs in-tree |
| **`deploy-walk status`** | Append **`worktree=<absolute-path>`** when known |

When **`worktreePath`** is missing but agent-executable steps need a cwd, surface one line: *No worktree in inline context — resolve **`worktreePath`** before running in-tree commands* — do not guess cwd from chat.

After merge cleanup the session worktree may be gone — After deploy walks often have no **`worktreePath`**; do not invent a path. [Return to implementation from deploy walk](#return-to-implementation-from-deploy-walk-inline-handback) creates a **new** worktree when the developer picks **`return-to-implementation-new-worktree`**.

## Deploy developer-await modal options (binding)

Every **AskQuestion** / **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** gate while a deploy step awaits developer input (manual step presentation, block follow-up, After-deploy closure, sub-section completion hints) **must** include these options unless the gate table below explicitly omits one:

| Option id | Label (brief) |
|-----------|---------------|
| *(gate-specific)* | Step done / skip / block / closure / present-next — per gate table |
| `return-to-implementation-new-worktree` | Return to implementation — new worktree |
| `more-details` | More details for option _ |

**`return-to-implementation-new-worktree`** — developer found a product defect during deploy verification (including after the PR merged). Set **`outputs.returnToImplementation: true`** in **`## Completion (inline)`** and stop the walk. Parent **`coding-session`** runs [Return to implementation from deploy walk](../coding-session/SKILL.md#return-to-implementation-from-deploy-walk-new-worktree) on the **next** turn — **do not** edit product code from this skill.

On inline start, run [Inline walk bootstrap](#inline-walk-bootstrap) — do not wait for `deploy-walk present 1`.

The skill is **loose mode by design** on **manual** steps. Between `deploy-walk present <N>` (manual presentation) and `deploy-walk <N> done` / `skip` / `block`, the chat is **normal collaboration** — the **developer** can ask questions, paste logs, debug. **Agent-executable** steps do **not** wait for `deploy-walk present <N>` — the agent runs them, updates the plan, and continues.

**State lives in the plan file, not in chat memory.** The skill re-reads the plan on every command. A walk that started yesterday, was interrupted by 30 other turns, and resumed today still works — the agent finds the same `[ ]` boxes and the same `**Status:**` line.

The procedure below is a hard contract — do **not** skip steps, infer state from chat memory, or mark a step `[x]` without a passing run (agent-executable) or developer resolution (manual). Do **not** skip **manual** steps without developer `done` / `skip` / `block`.

## Agent-executable vs manual steps

Classify each unchecked step **before** acting. When classification is ambiguous, use **AskQuestion** once (recap + modal) — do **not** guess credentials, environments, or subjective UI checks.

### Agent-executable (auto-run — no approval)

Run **without** an **AskQuestion** approval gate **before each agent-executable step** (mid-turn tool work). Use **`worktreePath`** from inline context when present — recap **`cwd: <absolute-path>`** per [Worktree path visibility (binding)](#worktree-path-visibility-binding); otherwise resolve cwd from plan anchor or chat. When an auto-run pass **ends the assistant turn** without chaining further steps, still close with structured choice per [`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc`](.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc) § **Turn completion invariant** (include [Deploy developer-await modal options](#deploy-developer-await-modal-options-binding) when awaiting developer input).

| Examples | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| Unit / integration tests (`npm test`, `pytest`, `go test`, `cargo test`, …) | Run in the worktree; exit 0 = pass |
| Repo scripts (`./scripts/verify-*.sh`, `make test`, documented package scripts) | Read script first when non-obvious |
| `curl` / `wget` / HTTP checks to **localhost**, staging URLs, or endpoints documented in the step when credentials/env are already available in the session | Do **not** invent secrets; if env vars are missing, treat as manual or **block** |
| File / config assertions (`test -f`, grep, read expected artifact) | |
| `git` read-only checks relevant to the step (branch, diff stat) | No `git commit` / `git push` from this skill |
| Lint / typecheck / build smoke named in the step | |

**On pass:** apply `deploy-walk <N> done: <note>` semantics in the same turn — note must cite the command (or script) and outcome (e.g. *exit 0*, *HTTP 200*, *all tests passed*).

**On fail:** do **not** flip the box. Either **`deploy-walk <N> block: <reason>`** with stderr/exit code, or present the failure and assist debug (manual collaboration) until the developer chooses done / skip / block.

**Auto-advance:** after marking step N done, immediately process step N+1 in the **same assistant turn** when it is also agent-executable. Stop the chain when the next step is **manual**, **blocked**, sub-section complete, or a lifecycle gate applies (see [Inline walk bootstrap](#inline-walk-bootstrap)).

### Manual (developer-led)

| Examples | Agent behavior |
|----------|----------------|
| Browser / UI verification, visual review, product sign-off | Present numbered **Testing steps** per [Step presentation contract](#step-4--step-presentation-contract); wait for developer |
| Production dashboard, on-call judgment, “confirm with teammate” | Same |
| Steps requiring credentials, VPN, or hardware the agent cannot access | Same — **Testing steps** include commands the developer runs locally |
| Subjective “feels right in staging” without automatable assertion | Same — **Testing steps** name concrete observations to record |

**No auto-run** and **no auto-flip** until the developer invokes `deploy-walk <N> done`, `skip`, or `block`, or free-form equivalent confirmed in one line.

### Inline walk bootstrap

When run **inline** on **`coding-session`** (first turn after inline context validates):

1. Resolve plan (Step 1) and read § N (Step 2).
2. Run [Autonomous agent-executable pass](#autonomous-agent-executable-pass) from the first unchecked step in the active sub-section.
3. Stop on the first **manual** step with full presentation, on **block**, or when the inline scope is satisfied (`local-test-only` / `staging-test-only` sub-section complete, or full walk terminal rules).

Do **not** wait for the developer to send `deploy-walk present 1` first when agent-executable steps are queued at the front of the checklist.

## Autonomous agent-executable pass

Repeat until stop condition:

1. Re-read the plan; find the lowest-numbered `[ ]` in the active sub-section (respect `deployWalkScope` and `**Status:**` routing).
2. If none remain, run sub-section / lifecycle completion branches (Before complete → `deploy-walk deployed` hint or terminal; After complete → closure gate).
3. Classify the step ([Agent-executable vs manual steps](#agent-executable-vs-manual-steps)).
4. **Agent-executable:** run it → on pass, `StrReplace` flip + note → continue loop in the **same turn**.
5. **Manual:** present step N with numbered **Testing steps** per [Step presentation contract](#step-4--step-presentation-contract) and **stop** — wait for developer message.

**Forbidden:** **AskQuestion** “may I run this test?” before an agent-executable step. **Forbidden:** mark manual steps done without developer resolution.

## Trigger

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `deploy-walk present <N>` | Process step N: if **agent-executable**, run → flip on pass → auto-advance while the next steps are also agent-executable; if **manual**, present in detail. Sub-section auto-resolved from **`**Status:**`**: `drafted` → `### Local test`; `pr-open` → `### Staging test`; `deployed` → `### After deploy`; `done` → all-checked summary. |
| `deploy-walk present local <N>` / `deploy-walk present staging <N>` / `deploy-walk present after <N>` | Same, with the sub-section forced explicitly. Legacy: `present before <N>` → `present local <N>`. Always works regardless of status — the explicit out-of-order escape hatch. |
| `deploy-walk present <slug> <N>` (or with `before` / `after`) | Same, with the target plan named explicitly. Use when chat context spans multiple PR plans. |
| `deploy-walk <N> done` | Flip step N's `[ ]` → `[x]`, append `*(YYYY-MM-DD: done.)*`, advance hint to step N+1. |
| `deploy-walk <N> done: <note>` | Flip + append `*(YYYY-MM-DD: <note>)*` (period at end of note is the agent's responsibility). |
| `deploy-walk <N> skip: <reason>` | Flip + strike-through step text + append `*(YYYY-MM-DD: Skipped — <reason>)*`. The strike is GFM `~~text~~`. |
| `deploy-walk <N> block: <reason>` | **No flip** — box stays `[ ]`. Append `*(YYYY-MM-DD: Blocked — <reason>)*` after the step text. |
| `deploy-walk pr-open` | Flip `**Status:**` from `drafted` → `pr-open`, append `*(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: pr-open.)*` to the history. Run from **`coding-session`** after **`create-pr`** succeeds. |
| `deploy-walk pr-open: <note>` | Same + append the note. |
| `deploy-walk deployed` | Flip `**Status:**` from `pr-open` → `deployed` (or `drafted` → `deployed` on legacy plans with no Staging test), append `*(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: deployed.)*` to the history. |
| `deploy-walk deployed: <note>` | Same + append the note. |
| `deploy-walk status` | Read-only one-line summary: status, Before X/Y, After X/Y, last transition date. No edits. |

Free-form English equivalents (e.g. *"step 3 done — staging green"*, *"actually skip step 4, the regression suite covers it"*) are interpreted by the agent into one of the canonical commands above; the agent confirms the interpretation in one line *before* applying the edit. If the interpretation is ambiguous, use **AskQuestion** with concrete options instead of guessing.

**Auto-advance (agent-executable only):** after `deploy-walk <N> done` from an agent run, continue to step N+1 in the same turn when N+1 is agent-executable.

**Manual steps:** after `deploy-walk <N> done` from the developer, the confirmation names the next step. If N+1 is agent-executable, run [Autonomous agent-executable pass](#autonomous-agent-executable-pass) immediately (do not wait for `deploy-walk present <next>`). If N+1 is manual, wait for `deploy-walk present <next>` or developer continuation.

## Step 1 — Resolve the target plan

The target is a `.plan.md` file under the **`.sedea/operations/`** plan union with a `## N. Deploy test plan` section. Resolve it from chat context per [`30_planning-target-resolution.mdc`](../../../../rules/30_planning-target-resolution.mdc) § *Resolution order*, with **one additional filter**: only consider plans whose body has `## N. Deploy test plan` *and* a `**Status:**` line.

Resolution order (highest confidence first):

1. **Explicit slug in the command.** `deploy-walk present 1_server_side_preview_endpoint_f4fe9ae9 3` — use the named slug verbatim (with or without the `_<hex>` suffix; match against `name:` frontmatter or filename stem).
2. **Mid-walk continuation.** Same chat already invoked `deploy-walk present <M>` against a specific plan; continue with that plan unless the **developer** names a different one.
3. **Most recent agent recommendation.** The agent's last turn listed a **deploy-walk** step command in **`display.markdown`** or structured-choice **`options`** against a specific plan.
4. **Single candidate in chat context.** Exactly one PR plan was read / referenced in the recent chat window — use it.
5. **Multiple candidates.** Stop and use **AskQuestion** listing PR plans with at least one unchecked `[ ]` in their `## N. Deploy test plan`. The **developer** picks; subsequent commands stick with that plan.
6. **No candidate.** Stop with: *"**deploy-walk** needs a target PR plan. Per **planning-target-resolution** and **`../README.md`** § *Recap, structured choice, act*, emit a fresh "Where we are now in the plan tree" snapshot, then collect the lane pick via **AskQuestion**, **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** (§ *Sedea input channel* — prefer recap + modal in one message), then re-invoke."*

The IDE focused-file list (host-injected **open and recently viewed files** metadata) is **not** consulted.

Acknowledge the resolved target in one line: *"Target plan: `{slug}` (resolved from {source})."*

## Step 2 — Read § N Deploy test plan and parse the lifecycle

Read the target plan in full (`Read` tool, no offset, no limit) and locate its Deploy test plan section. Match by **name**, not number — both `## 7. Deploy test plan` (current per-PR template) and `## 6. Deploy test plan` (legacy 7-section per-PR plans) are valid section numbers; the skill is agnostic.

Inside the section, parse:

1. **`**Status:** {state} *(YYYY-MM-DD: ...)* …`** — the lifecycle line. State must be `drafted`, `pr-open`, `deployed`, or `done`. History entries are appended over time as italic-parenthetical notes; do not strip them.
2. **`### Local test`** — numbered `1. [ ] …` / `1. [x] …` task list (legacy **`### Before deploy`** reads as Local test).
3. **`### Staging test`** — same shape.
4. **`### After deploy`** — same shape.

Sub-section heading inference, when not pinned by the command:

| Status | Active sub-section |
|---|---|
| `drafted` | `### Local test` (advance to Staging only via `deploy-walk pr-open` after PR creation, or `deploy-walk present staging <N>` explicit override). |
| `pr-open` | `### Staging test`. |
| `deployed` | `### After deploy`. |
| `done` | All-checked. `deploy-walk present <N>` returns the summary, no edit. |

If the **Status:** line is missing (legacy plan or not yet swept to the new convention), fall back to the heuristic: any `[ ]` in `### Local test` or legacy `### Before deploy` → Local test; else any `[ ]` in `### Staging test` → Staging; else After. Surface this as a flag in the agent's reply: *"Plan lacks the `**Status:**` lifecycle marker. Falling back to checkbox heuristic. Add `**Status:** drafted *(YYYY-MM-DD: PR plan drafted.)*` above `### Local test` to enable status-aware routing — this is what the **`pr-plan`** protocol branch template emits for new plans."*

If the Deploy test plan section uses **dash bullets** (`- ...`) instead of numbered task list (`1. [ ] ...`), stop with: *"`{slug}`'s § N Deploy test plan uses dash bullets, not the GFM task list contract this skill expects (`1. [ ] ...`). Convert the section to numbered checkboxes (one-time sweep) before invoking **deploy-walk**. The **`pr-plan`** template emits the right shape for new plans."*

## Step 3 — Branch by command and execute

Each command has its own contract. After agent-executable auto-runs, you may chain multiple steps in one turn. When a **manual** step is presented, the walk is **blocked**, or a lifecycle gate applies, close with **AskQuestion** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** (step status + next action) — do **not** prose-only “stop and wait for the next user message.”

**Turn completion (binding):** When the assistant turn ends, **always** emit structured choice per [`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc`](.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc) § **Turn completion invariant**. Put recap and suggested next walk actions in **`display.markdown`**; mirror each choosable path in **`options`** (for example *Present step N+1*, *Mark deployed*, *Step N done*, *Deploy walk status*). The developer may still type **`deploy-walk …`** commands in chat, but **forbidden** as the sole turn ending: “reply when ready”, “tell me when done”, or command hints without a modal.

### `deploy-walk present <N>` — process step N

Find the Nth numbered item in the active sub-section (regex `^N\. \[[ x]\] `). Then:

- If the box is already `[x]`, recap the checked step in **`display.markdown`**, then close with **AskQuestion** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`**: re-walk step N (before/after), present step N+1, or **More details for option _**. If N+1 is `[ ]` and agent-executable, you may run [Autonomous agent-executable pass](#autonomous-agent-executable-pass) from N+1 without waiting.
- If the box is `[ ]` and has a prior `*(YYYY-MM-DD: Blocked — {reason})*` annotation, surface it: *"Previously blocked: {reason} (YYYY-MM-DD). Has the blocker cleared?"* Then classify — re-run if agent-executable and developer cleared the blocker; else present as manual.
- If the box is `[ ]` and clean, **classify**:
 - **Agent-executable** — run per [Agent-executable vs manual steps](#agent-executable-vs-manual-steps); on pass flip and auto-advance; on fail block or assist.
 - **Manual** — present with numbered **Testing steps** per § *Step 4 — Step presentation contract*, then close with **AskQuestion** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** per [Deploy developer-await modal options](#deploy-developer-await-modal-options-binding) (step done / blocked / skip / return-to-implementation / more-details) — do not prose-only stop.

### `deploy-walk <N> done` / `deploy-walk <N> done: <note>` — flip box, advance hint

`StrReplace` to flip:

- `old_string`: `{line N verbatim}` (the entire line, e.g. `1. [ ] Confirm staging is healthy.`).
- `new_string`: `{line N with [ ] → [x] and the note appended}` (e.g. `1. [x] Confirm staging is healthy. *(2026-05-14: staging green, no alerts pending.)*`).

If `{note}` is omitted in `deploy-walk <N> done`, append `*(YYYY-MM-DD: done.)*` (literal phrase). Use today's date from the agent's clock context.

After the edit, **check whether step N was the last `[ ]` in the active sub-section**:

- If `### Local test` (legacy **`### Before deploy`**) is now fully `[x]` and Status is `drafted`, hand back to **`coding-session`** for pre-pr-review — do **not** flip to `pr-open` until **`create-pr`** succeeds.
- If `### Staging test` is now fully `[x]` and Status is `pr-open`, close with **AskQuestion** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`**: *Continue to PR review*, *Review Staging-test checklist*, or **More details for option _**.
- If `### After deploy` is now fully `[x]` and Status is `deployed`, stop after marking the step and ask the developer for explicit closure approval with **AskQuestion** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`**. Required options (plus **`return-to-implementation-new-worktree`** and **More details for option _** per [Deploy developer-await modal options](#deploy-developer-await-modal-options-binding)):

| Option id | Label (brief) |
|-----------|---------------|
| `approve-deploy-closure` | Approve deploy checklist closure |
| `review-deploy-checklist` | Review deploy checklist first |
| `leave-status-deployed` | Leave status deployed |
| `return-to-implementation-new-worktree` | Return to implementation — new worktree |
| `more-details` | More details for option _ |

Only **`approve-deploy-closure`** authorizes the Status `deployed → done` flip and the **Frontmatter capstone** `deploy-test-plan-verified` `pending → done` mutation. Do not treat the final step's `done` command as approval for the larger deploy lifecycle closeout. **`return-to-implementation-new-worktree`** sets **`outputs.returnToImplementation: true`** — hand back to **`coding-session`**; do **not** flip to `done`.
- Otherwise, if step N+1 is **agent-executable**, continue [Autonomous agent-executable pass](#autonomous-agent-executable-pass) in the same turn (no `deploy-walk present` wait).
- If step N+1 is **manual**, close with **AskQuestion** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`**: *Present step N+1* (equivalent to **`deploy-walk present <N+1>`**), report agent-assisted results, or **More details for option _** — put the verbatim next unchecked step line in **`display.markdown`**.

### `deploy-walk <N> skip: <reason>` — strike + flip

`StrReplace` to flip with strike-through:

- `old_string`: `{line N verbatim}` (e.g. `1. [ ] Confirm staging is healthy.`).
- `new_string`: `{line N with [ ] → [x] and the step text wrapped in ~~ ~~, plus skip note}` (e.g. `1. [x] ~~Confirm staging is healthy.~~ *(2026-05-14: Skipped — covered by phase 4's regression suite.)*`).

The strike-through is GFM `~~text~~`. Skipped steps count toward sub-section completion (status-flip logic and "all checked?" detection treat them the same as `done`).

Confirmation: *"Marked {Local, Staging, or After}-deploy step N skipped: \"{reason}\". Next: step N+1 — ..."* (or the all-checked branch).

### `deploy-walk <N> block: <reason>` — note only, no flip

`StrReplace` to append a block note **without flipping**:

- `old_string`: `{line N verbatim}`.
- `new_string`: `{line N}` + ` *(YYYY-MM-DD: Blocked — {reason})*` (append the block note after the full step line; e.g. `1. [ ] Curl staging endpoint with each of the 9 \`pushType\` values. *(2026-05-14: Blocked — staging push-shared@2.4 not yet deployed; awaiting dispatch from #infra.)*`).

The box stays `[ ]`. The skill stops the loop — no next-step hint, no auto-advance. The **developer** re-invokes `deploy-walk present <N>` later when the blocker clears, at which point the prior block note is surfaced (per § *Step 3 — `deploy-walk present <N>`* above).

Confirmation: *"Marked {Local, Staging, or After}-deploy step N blocked: \"{reason}\". Box left `[ ]`. Re-invoke `deploy-walk present <N>` once the blocker clears."*

### `deploy-walk pr-open` / `deploy-walk pr-open: <note>` — status transition `drafted → pr-open`

Pre-conditions:

- Status must currently be `drafted`. Invoke from **`coding-session`** after **`create-pr`** succeeds (or when the developer explicitly confirms an open PR on the same ship chain).
- If any `[ ]` boxes remain in `### Local test`, use **AskQuestion** before flipping: proceed with unchecked Local-test steps vs review first.

`StrReplace` on the Status line:

- `old_string`: `**Status:** drafted {existing-history}`
- `new_string`: `**Status:** pr-open {existing-history} *(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: pr-open.)*`

After status flip, when `### Staging test` has unchecked items, run [Inline walk bootstrap](#inline-walk-bootstrap) for staging scope or close with structured choice to start Staging test walk.

### `deploy-walk deployed` / `deploy-walk deployed: <note>` — status transition `pr-open → deployed`

Pre-conditions:

- Status must currently be `pr-open` (or `drafted` on legacy plans with no Staging test section). If `deployed` or `done`, reply: *"Status is already `{current}`. To override, reply `deploy-walk deployed force` (**developer** escape hatch — only use if the plan's lifecycle drifted from reality)."* (Skill's `force` branch is identical to the normal branch; the gate is the **developer**'s confirmation.)
- If any `[ ]` boxes remain in `### Staging test`, do **not** flip status yet. Use **AskQuestion** to confirm whether the developer wants to merge with unchecked Staging-test steps. Required options:
 - **Proceed to deployed with unchecked Staging-test steps**
 - **Review Staging-test steps first**
 - **Block deploy transition**
 - **More details for option _**
 Only **Proceed to deployed with unchecked Staging-test steps** authorizes the status mutation. If approved, include a note listing unchecked indexes in the confirmation so the omission is auditable.

`StrReplace` on the Status line:

- `old_string`: `**Status:** drafted {existing-history}` (the full current line, including all prior `*(...)*` entries).
- `new_string`: `**Status:** deployed {existing-history} *(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: deployed.)*` (or with the user's note in place of `deployed.`). Time uses 24-hour `HH:MM` from the agent's clock context.

After status flip, close with **AskQuestion** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`**: *Present After-deploy step 1* (equivalent to **`deploy-walk present 1`**), *Deploy walk status*, or **More details for option _** — put the verbatim first After-deploy step line in **`display.markdown`**.

If `### After deploy` has no `[ ]` items at all (it's empty by design or already all `[x]` — unusual), reply: *"Status flipped: `drafted → deployed`. No `### After deploy` steps remain. Deploy checklist closure still requires approval."* Then run the same **Approve deploy checklist closure** gate used by the last After-deploy `done` branch before flipping `deployed → done` or changing `deploy-test-plan-verified` to `done`.

### `deploy-walk status` — read-only summary

No edits. Reply with one line summarising the plan's current state (plain text or a single fenced `text` line — do **not** use raw `<…>` placeholders, which Markdown parsers treat as HTML tags):

```text
{slug} — Status: {state} (last transition: {YYYY-MM-DD}). Local: {Lx}/{Ly} ✓. Staging: {Sx}/{Sy} ✓. After: {Ax}/{Ay} ✓. worktree={absolute-path when worktreePath set}
```

Where `{Lx}`/`{Ly}` count Local test (legacy Before deploy), `{Sx}`/`{Sy}` Staging test, `{Ax}`/`{Ay}` After deploy, `{state}` from the `**Status:**` line, and `{YYYY-MM-DD}` from the latest `*(…)*` history entry when present. If no `**Status:**` line is found, surface: *"No `**Status:**` lifecycle marker — pre-skill plan format."*

## Step 4 — Step presentation contract

Use this structure for **manual** steps only (or when an agent-executable run **failed** and you are handing back to the developer). Do **not** present first and wait when the step is agent-executable and runnable — run it per [Agent-executable vs manual steps](#agent-executable-vs-manual-steps).

When presenting a manual step, **print numbered step-by-step testing instructions** the developer can follow without inferring missing actions. **Plan path:** show the absolute path you resolved in Step 1 (from **`plan-state resolve`** output, an explicit path the **developer** supplied, or the read tool path). Do **not** use `~/.cursor/plans/` or other non-**`.sedea/operations/`** locations for hosting repo plan IO.

Use a **blockquote** or plain lines for the presentation shell — **do not** put `{slug}`, paths, or `{state}` inside raw `<…>` angle brackets (Markdown/HTML will eat them). Template:

> **Plan:** {slug} — {absolute-path-to.plan.md} — Section: § N {Local, Staging, or After} deploy, step {N} of {total}.
> **Status:** {state} (last transition: {YYYY-MM-DD}).
> **Worktree:** {absolute-worktreePath} *(omit this line only when `worktreePath` is absent from inline context)*
>
> ### Step
>
> *(verbatim text from the plan, including any inline `code spans` or **bold**)*
>
> ### Why
>
> *(any italic *because* phrasing in the plan body adjacent to or inside this step — search the surrounding paragraph for `*...*` runs that explain rationale; if there isn't one, omit this sub-section)*
>
> ### Testing steps
>
> 1. *(first concrete action — open URL, run command, navigate UI)*
> 2. *(next action with inputs filled or `TODO:` markers)*
> 3. *(verification checkpoint — what to observe, expected signal)*
> *(continue until the full manual test is executable without inference)*
>
> ### Expected outcome
>
> *(pass/fail criteria after all testing steps — HTTP status, response shape, log line, SQL output, dashboard signal. Pull from the step text + repo conventions; be concrete, not aspirational)*
>
> ### Commands / context
>
> *(full commands referenced in **Testing steps** — expand shorthand; "each of the 9 `pushType` values" → enumerated list; "psql ..." → full command with env vars filled or `TODO: fill in`; "curl staging" → full curl with headers and body)*
>
> ### Cross-references
>
> *(if the step depends on another phase or PR being live, name it: "This step assumes phase 4's PUT contract is deployed." If the step has a related caveat in § 8, name it: "See § 8 caveat 2 for the rebase implication.")*
>
> ---
>
> **Manual step** — follow **Testing steps** in order. Close this turn with **AskQuestion** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** per [Deploy developer-await modal options](#deploy-developer-await-modal-options-binding) — step done, step skip (with reason), step blocked (with reason), **return-to-implementation-new-worktree**, or **More details for option _** — put equivalent **`deploy-walk <N> done` / `skip` / `block`** command text in **`display.markdown`** or option labels when helpful.

### Testing steps authoring rules

1. **Testing steps** is **mandatory** for every manual presentation — a numbered list (`1.` … `N.`). Minimum one step; prefer **3–7** when the plan step implies multiple actions.
2. Each sub-step is **one action + one checkpoint** (run command → check output; open page → confirm element; trigger flow → verify side effect).
3. Expand plan shorthand into executable detail (URLs, curl bodies, CLI flags, UI paths, env vars as `TODO:` when unknown).
4. **Forbidden:** manual presentation with only context blocks and **no** **Testing steps** list.
5. When an agent-executable run **failed** and you hand back to the developer, include **Testing steps** for the retry path (same rules).

**Example** (plan step: `Confirm staging health dashboard shows no alerts`):

```markdown
### Testing steps
1. Open `{STAGING_DASHBOARD_URL}` (or run `open https://staging.example.com/health`).
2. Filter to service `{service}` and window **Last 15 minutes**.
3. Confirm **Active alerts** = 0 and **Error rate** below the threshold named in the plan step.
4. Screenshot or paste the dashboard summary in chat if the signal is ambiguous.
```

If a sub-section ("Why" or "Cross-references") has nothing to say, omit it rather than emit a placeholder. If "Expected outcome" is genuinely ambiguous for a **manual** step, use **AskQuestion** to clarify what counts as success before the **developer** runs anything. For **agent-executable** ambiguity (missing env, unclear pass criteria), use **AskQuestion** to classify *agent-run* vs *manual* — not to approve a run you already know is agent-executable.

The presentation should be **detail-oriented**, not minimalist. Long presentations are fine; lazy ones aren't.

## Step 5 — Edit mechanics

`StrReplace` is the only tool used for edits. The step text is usually unique within the file (numbered + bracketed = effectively keyed). When it isn't (rare; e.g. the same one-liner appears in both Before and After), include the sub-section heading + the line in `old_string`:

```
old_string:
### Before deploy

1. [ ] Confirm staging is healthy.

new_string:
### Before deploy

1. [x] Confirm staging is healthy. *(2026-05-14: staging green, no alerts pending.)*
```

Status-line edits are similar — the `**Status:** {state}` prefix + first history entry is unique:

```
old_string: **Status:** drafted *(2026-05-14: PR plan drafted.)*
new_string: **Status:** deployed *(2026-05-14: PR plan drafted.)* *(2026-05-14 14:32: deployed — push-svc canary @ commit a1b2c3d.)*
```

For block-then-resume, the `done` edit `old_string` includes the prior block note so it's preserved as audit trail:

```
old_string: 1. [ ] Curl staging endpoint with each of the 9 `pushType` values. *(2026-05-14: Blocked — staging push-shared@2.4 not yet deployed.)*
new_string: 1. [x] Curl staging endpoint with each of the 9 `pushType` values. *(2026-05-14: Blocked — staging push-shared@2.4 not yet deployed.)* *(2026-05-15: done — staging deploy completed overnight; all 9 returned 200 + non-empty arrays.)*
```

History is **append-only**. Never overwrite or compact prior `*(YYYY-MM-DD: ...)*` entries.

## Frontmatter capstone — `deploy-test-plan-verified` (`pending` → `done`)

PR plans carry a YAML todo whose `id` is **`deploy-test-plan-verified`** (see [`development-process.md`](../../../../docs/development-process.md) § *Per-PR plan template* § 7 — Frontmatter capstone). It stays `pending` until every Local-test, Staging-test, and After-deploy checkbox is `[x]` **and** the deploy section's `**Status:**` reads `done`.

Only after the developer approves **Approve deploy checklist closure**, when this skill sets `**Status:**` from `deployed` → `done` (last After-deploy checkbox, or the empty-After-deploy chain from `deploy-walk deployed`), **immediately** apply a second `StrReplace` on frontmatter using this **exact** `old_string` / `new_string` pair (byte-identical to [`pr-plan`](../pr-plan/SKILL.md) § 4a-bis and on-disk plans — do not paraphrase the `content: >-` body):

```
old_string:
 - id: deploy-test-plan-verified
 content: >-
 Mark done only when every Local-test, Staging-test, and After-deploy step is checked
 (`[x]`) and the deploy section `**Status:**` reads `done` (walk via `deploy-walk`,
 or edit manually). Independent of PR merge; run `plan-reconcile` protocol branch when you want
 reconcile/archive after merges.
 status: pending

new_string:
 - id: deploy-test-plan-verified
 content: >-
 Mark done only when every Local-test, Staging-test, and After-deploy step is checked
 (`[x]`) and the deploy section `**Status:**` reads `done` (walk via `deploy-walk`,
 or edit manually). Independent of PR merge; run `plan-reconcile` protocol branch when you want
 reconcile/archive after merges.
 status: done
```

- If the `old_string` block is **not found** (plan lacks the todo, or `content:` was edited and no longer matches), **do not** fail the Status flip — the deploy section is already correct. Reply with a **flag**: *"Could not find canonical `deploy-test-plan-verified` block — add it per **`pr-plan`** § 4a-bis (or hand-insert), then set `status: done` to match § 7."* Optionally append the canonical block with `status: done` immediately before `isProject:` if the plan has zero deploy-capstone todo.
- If `status` is already `done`, skip the second `StrReplace` (idempotent re-run).

**`plan-reconcile` is not invoked.** Finishing the walk does not run **plan-reconcile** — merge-driven reconcile is a separate **developer** gesture (mission dispatch or natural language to the **plan-reconcile** protocol branch).

## Auto-resolution rules — `deploy-walk present <N>` without sub-section

When the user runs `deploy-walk present <N>` (no `before` / `after`), pick the sub-section per the **Status** column above. The full table:

| Status | `deploy-walk present <N>` routes to |
|---|---|
| `drafted` | `### Local test` step N (legacy Before deploy). |
| `pr-open` | `### Staging test` step N. |
| `deployed` | `### After deploy` step N. If N exceeds After's count, same pattern. |
| `done` | One-line summary in **`display.markdown`**, then structured choice: re-walk a step (local/staging/after), **Deploy walk status**, or **More details for option _** — do not prose-only stop.
| missing | Heuristic fallback (Local → Staging → After) plus a flag noting the missing Status marker. |

`deploy-walk present local <N>`, `deploy-walk present staging <N>`, and `deploy-walk present after <N>` always work regardless of status — they're the explicit out-of-order escape hatch. Legacy: `present before <N>` → local. If they hit a sub-section the status disagrees with (e.g. `deploy-walk present after 1` while Status is `drafted`), surface a one-line warning at the top of the step presentation:

> **Status mismatch:** PR is `drafted` (not deployed yet). Proceeding with After-deploy step 1 anyway because you asked explicitly.

No blocking — the **developer** is in control.

## Edge cases

1. **Multi-line step text.** A `1. [ ] …` step (arbitrary `{text}` on the first line) may wrap across multiple lines if the text is long (Markdown allows continuation lines indented under the list item). Capture the full step in `old_string` — read enough lines after the `1.` line to include all wrapped content. The flip and note still go on the *first* line (after the `[x]`) — wrapped continuation lines stay as-is.
2. **Step text with backticks / inline code.** `StrReplace` is literal — escape nothing, copy verbatim from the file. Don't reformat.
3. **User typo on step number.** If `deploy-walk present 12` is invoked but the section has only 5 items, reply: *"Section has only 5 numbered items; `deploy-walk present 12` is out of range. Did you mean a different step number? Or run `deploy-walk status` for the current shape."*
4. **`deploy-walk <N> done` invoked without a prior `deploy-walk present <N>`.** The skill doesn't enforce ordering — `done` just flips the box. If the box was already `[x]`, surface: *"Step N was already `[x]` when this `done` arrived. No edit applied. Did you mean a different step number?"*
5. **Status line drifted (e.g. `deployed` but Before still has `[ ]` boxes).** This isn't an error condition — the **developer** may have deployed despite skipping some Before-deploy checks deliberately, or the previous `deploy-walk deployed` invocation surfaced the unchecked-box flag and the **developer** accepted it. The skill respects the Status line as the source of truth.
6. **Plan archived mid-walk.** If **`plan-state`** **`reconcile`** archives the plan between commands (rare; usually requires the PR to merge), the next command's Step-1 resolution must **re-resolve** the slug under **`.sedea/operations/`**. Archived plans keep the same **`plans/`** tree path with sidecar **`archived: true`** on **`<slug>.state.yaml`** (rule 8 — Plan Board does not read frontmatter `archived:`). Edits still apply via `StrReplace` on that path. Archival timing is **plan-reconcile** / **`plan-state`**'s concern, not this skill's.
7. **User wants to revert a `[x]` to `[ ]`.** Not a built-in command. If they ask, do the inverse `StrReplace` manually (flip `[x]` → `[ ]` and trim the trailing `*(...)*` note). Surface this as an unusual case — usually the right move is a fresh `deploy-walk <N> done` with a new note explaining what changed.
8. **Deploy walk on a non-PR plan (Master Plan, Phase plan, etc.).** Master Plans and Phase plans don't have `## N. Deploy test plan` sections — they have dual-title decomposition sections. If the user runs **deploy-walk** against one, stop with: *"Plan `{slug}` is a Master Plan, Phase plan, or Roadmap topic (pick which), which doesn't have a `## N. Deploy test plan` section. **deploy-walk** only walks PR plans (per-PR template § 7 / § 6). Did you mean a child PR plan?"*
9. **Roll-back.** Out of scope for v1. If a deploy fails and the user wants to flip status back to `drafted`, they edit the Status line manually.
10. **Long agent-executable chains.** If more than ~5 agent-executable steps remain, you may stop after a batch with a one-line recap in **`display.markdown`** (*"Steps 1–5 auto-passed; step 6 is manual — presenting now."*) and either continue presenting step 6 in the same turn or close with structured choice per **Turn completion (binding)** above — do not silently skip steps or end the turn without a modal.

## Scope guard

This skill walks **one PR plan's `## N. Deploy test plan` section at a time**. It does **not**:

- Run **manual** steps without developer resolution — present numbered **Testing steps**, assist, wait for `done` / `skip` / `block`.
- Run destructive or irreversible production changes (deploy to prod, delete data, rotate secrets) unless the step text explicitly requires it **and** the developer chose that path in the same message — prefer **block** + AskQuestion when unsure.
- **`git commit`**, **`git push`**, or any other write to the **hosting** git tree on behalf of the **developer** unless they explicitly ask in the same message. Plan body edits are normal **`StrReplace`** on the **`.plan.md`** file; syncing **`.sedea/operations/`** (or the hosting repo) to version control follows the **developer**'s workflow and hosting repo docs — this skill does **not** prescribe a monorepo-specific plan-commit command.
- Reconcile / archive the plan when it reaches `done`, or auto-run **`plan-reconcile`**. **`plan-reconcile`** is never auto-invoked from this skill. The `done` flip + frontmatter `deploy-test-plan-verified` → `done` close the **deploy checklist only**; archival still depends on merge + explicit **plan-reconcile** (see **development-process** cadence).
- Spawn child plans, edit other plans, or modify the parent plan's PR list / scope. Those are **`planner`**, **`pr-breakdown`**, **`phase-planner`**, etc.
- Run **`coding-session`**, **`pre-pr-review`**, **`pr-review`**, or any other protocol branch from inside this one. If the **developer** wants those, they invoke them via mission dispatch or natural language.
- Apply to plans without the GFM task list contract (`1. [ ] ...`). Pre-skill plans must be swept first; the skill stops with a clear message instead of guessing.
- Walk "all PR plans in flight" in batch. Cross-plan dashboards can come later as a one-line script over **`.sedea/operations/.../plans/`**; the skill is per-plan.

## Inline result contract

When run inline on **`coding-session`**, report these fields in prose via **`## Completion (inline)`** so the parent can merge into coding-session `outputs`:

- `outputs.targetPlanPath`
- `outputs.targetPlanSlug`
- `outputs.prUrl`
- `outputs.prNumber`
- `outputs.mergeSha`
- `outputs.deployStatus` (`drafted` | `pr-open` | `deployed` | `done` | `blocked` | `unknown`)
- `outputs.localTestStatus` (`complete` | `incomplete` | `blocked` | `unknown`) — legacy alias `beforeDeployStatus`
- `outputs.stagingTestStatus` (`complete` | `incomplete` | `blocked` | `unknown`)
- `outputs.afterDeployStatus` (`complete` | `incomplete` | `blocked` | `unknown`)
- `outputs.deployTodoStatus` (`pending` | `done` | `missing` | `unknown`)
- `outputs.blockedStep`
- `outputs.remainingTasks`
- `outputs.shipPhase` — `deploy-walk` while checklist in progress; update when blocked or done
- `outputs.rowStatus` — `open` while steps remain; `closed` when `deployStatus` and `deployTodoStatus` are both `done`; `blocked` when a deploy step is blocked
- `outputs.blockedReason` — when `rowStatus` is `blocked` (name the blocked step)
- `outputs.returnToImplementation` — **`true`** when the developer chose **`return-to-implementation-new-worktree`** at a deploy gate; parent **`coding-session`** opens a new worktree (see [Return to implementation from deploy walk](#return-to-implementation-from-deploy-walk-inline-handback))

## Return to implementation from deploy walk (inline handback)

When the developer selects **`return-to-implementation-new-worktree`** at any [Deploy developer-await modal options](#deploy-developer-await-modal-options-binding) gate:

1. **Do not** flip deploy checklist boxes or Status to `done` as part of this pick.
2. Set **`outputs.returnToImplementation: true`**, keep **`deployStatus`** / sub-section state as-is (document the active step index in **`outputs.remainingTasks`** when useful).
3. Report via **`## Completion (inline)`** — parent **`coding-session`** runs [Return to implementation from deploy walk](../coding-session/SKILL.md#return-to-implementation-from-deploy-walk-new-worktree) on the **next** turn.
4. **Forbidden:** product edits, **`git commit`**, or new worktree creation from **`deploy-walk`** — parent owns worktree lifecycle.

Stop when a **manual** step is presented and awaiting developer input, when the walk is **blocked**, when Local-test scope is satisfied (`local-test-only`), when Staging-test scope is satisfied (`staging-test-only`), or when full post-merge walk reaches `done`. You **may** process multiple **agent-executable** steps in one turn before stopping. Do not auto-invoke other skills; do not commit hosting-repo git from this procedure.

## Mission Control section 8 sync (via coding-session)

**`deploy-walk`** is **not** a separate child terminal. §8 ship ledger fields reach the Squad Leader via **`coding-session`** terminal **`outputs`** on re-emit — include `targetPlanPath`, `shipPhase`, `rowStatus`, `deployStatus`, `deployTodoStatus`, `remainingTasks`, and `blockedReason` when applicable per **`../coding-session/SKILL.md`** § *Mission Control section 8 sync*. **Forbidden:** manual **Ship recap** on the leader dispatch.

## Completion (inline)

Report the fields from **## Inline result contract** in prose to the invoker on the **same lane**. Do **not** emit `AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`, `AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1`, or `MC_DISPATCH_RESOLVED_V1`. Do **not** add a **Host protocol line** (see **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/4_mission.mdc`** § *Inline completion* and **`.sedea/centers/sedea/skills/README.md`** § *Completion (inline)*).

Normally invoked inline from **`coding-session`** (Local test pre-merge, Staging test post–create-pr, or After deploy post-merge). Deploy phrases on the active coding-session lane use the same procedure body.
