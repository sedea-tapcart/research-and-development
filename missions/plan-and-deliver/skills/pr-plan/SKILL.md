# PR plan: §§ 1–4 from the parent plan

This skill drives the **per-PR planning move** under Sedea's New Feature Development Process: take a freshly-spawned PR plan stub (indexed child from the parent's **`### PR list`** under **`PR breakdown`**, typically right after the **`new-plan`** protocol branch) and populate §§ **1–4** of the **per-PR template** — Single concern, Background, Change scope, Reasoning. §§ **5–8** and the § 7 deploy scaffold stay **`_TBD_`** for **`coding-session`** and later turns unless the **developer** explicitly asks for a **fill** sketch here.

The agent has enough context after step 3 to draft §§ 1–4 from the parent's **`### PR list`** row, **`### Single-concern strategy`**, **`### Sequencing`**, and earlier parent sections (diagrams / changes as *context* — PR plans do **not** embed parent diagrams in the body). § 4 is consumed by **a coding agent** (PR description) and **pre-pr-review** / **a reviewer agent**; keep sentences unambiguous. This skill reports planning readiness; **worktrees and ship execution** belong to **`coding-session`** on a **separate** lane.

The procedure below is a hard contract — do **not** skip steps or start drafting before the target is verified as a PR plan stub.

## Handoff to `coding-session` (planning only)

**`pr-plan`** and **`coding-session`** are **sequential skills on different lanes** — not parent/child spawn.

| Concern | **`pr-plan`** (this skill) | **`coding-session`** |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Per-PR §§ **1–4** | Draft and maintain | Read; revise only when the developer returns to planning |
| Per-PR §§ **5–8** | Default **`_TBD_`**; optional *speculative* sketch if the developer picks step 5 option 2 | Substantive fill during implementation; final text once code paths are known |
| `readyForImplementation` | Set in `outputs` | Read as layer-1 hint only |
| Worktrees, session prompt, ship chain | Out of scope | Owns |
| Start **`coding-session`** | Step 5c option 4 names the next skill — **does not** emit **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** for **`coding-session`** on this lane | Developer starts via detached lane, mission dispatch, or snapshot |

After step 5c option 4, **stop** this lane. The developer opens **`coding-session`** elsewhere; layer 2 worktree approval happens there (**`coding-session`** § *Implementation consent*).

## Trigger

- Mission dispatch or explicit request to run the **`pr-plan`** protocol branch.
- Natural language: draft PR plan, populate PR plan body, fill per-PR §§ 1–4.
- Immediately after **`new-plan`** ignition when the parent dual-title is **`PR breakdown`** — the usual next step on the new child stub.

The **developer** picks the next move via **AskQuestion** or a **numbered** list you present.

## Step 1 — Identify the target plan and verify it's a PR plan stub

The skill operates on a **target** `.plan.md` resolved before this skill runs, per [`30_planning-target-resolution.mdc`](../../../../rules/30_planning-target-resolution.mdc) § *Resolution order*. Acknowledge the target slug in one line when this skill starts. Resolve targets from session, snapshot, or explicit path — **planning-target-resolution** is normative. Do **not** infer the target from the IDE’s focused-file list alone.

When spawned by `new-plan`, `targetPlanPath`, `targetPlanSlug`, `parentPlanPath`, `parentPlanSlug`, and `parentIndex` are already locked. Treat missing or conflicting values as a spawn-contract failure: stop with `failure` or `partial` and report the missing field. Do not fall back to IDE focus or free-form target discovery in spawned mode.

If there is no resolved target, **stop** and emit a fresh *Where we are now in the plan tree* snapshot; let the **developer** pick the lane via **AskQuestion** or numbered options, then continue.

Acknowledge in one line: *"Target plan: `<slug>`."*

### 1a — Verify the body's template state

Read the target plan in full and apply:

| Body state | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Has `## Overview` + `## Phasing` + `## Out of scope` (**new-plan** stub) | Fresh stub, drafting needed | Step 1b → Step 2 → Step 3 → Step 4 (full body rewrite) |
| Has `## 1. Single concern` … `## 4. Reasoning` with `_TBD_` under one or more of §§ 1–4 | Partially drafted | Step 1b → Step 2 → Step 3 → Step 4 (fill only still-`_TBD_` sections) |
| Has §§ 1–4 all populated | Already drafted | Step 5 (handoff menu) |
| Master Plan body (`## 4. Architectural design` + `## 6. Delivery phases \| PR breakdown`) | Wrong skill | **Stop:** use **`master-plan`**. |
| Phase plan body (`## 1. Background` … `## 4. Changes` for mode #2) | Wrong skill | **Stop:** use **`phase-plan`**. |

Acknowledge the body state in one line.

If the **new-plan** stub sections carry **non-stub user content**, merge it into § 2 / § 3 in your own words and **flag** that merge in the echo or handoff.

### 1b — Verify parent topology

Read the target plan's sidecar `<slug>.state.yaml` for `parent:`.

- `parent: null` (or sidecar missing) → **stop:** PR plans require a parent under **`PR breakdown`**. Fix via **`plan-reconcile`** or by hand, or use **`master-plan`** if this file should be a Master Plan.
- `parent:` does not resolve to an existing `.plan.md` under the same `.sedea/operations/.../plans/` tree → **stop:** fix sidecar before drafting.
- Parent is a **roadmap topic** grouping plan → **stop:** children should be Master Plans, not PR plans; fix sidecar or use **`master-plan`**.
- Parent resolves; read parent's dual-title block (`## 6. …` Master, `## 5. …` Phase):
  - Heading **`PR breakdown`** → proceed.
  - Heading **`Delivery phases`** → **stop:** use **`phase-plan`** on this file (phase child), not **`pr-plan`**.
  - Dual-title `Delivery phases | PR breakdown` still `_TBD_` → **stop:** run **`pr-breakdown`** (or **`delivery-phases`**) on the parent first.

Acknowledge: *"Parent: `<parent-slug>` (mode #3 **`PR breakdown`**); proceeding."*

If `parentPlanPath` / `parentPlanSlug` inputs were supplied, they must match the resolved sidecar parent and the parent file read here. If they conflict, stop with `failure`; the child was spawned against the wrong parent context.

## Step 2 — Load the development-process doc

Read `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/docs/development-process.md` with the Read tool, **no offset, no limit** (hosting repo root). Acknowledge: *"Loaded development-process.md; will follow § 3 per-PR template + § 6/§ 5 contents rule."*

Re-read every invocation; do not rely on session memory.

## Step 3 — Read the parent plan and find the PR row

Read the parent plan in full. Locate **`## 6. PR breakdown`** (Master parent) or **`## 5. PR breakdown`** (Phase parent). Inside: **`### Single-concern strategy`**, **`### Sequencing`**, **`### PR list`**.

### 3a — Match the target plan to a numbered item in `### PR list`

Match the target plan's `name:` to the **bolded slug** on a **`### PR list`** row. If spawned input includes `parentIndex`, inspect that exact item first and require it to match the target plan link or title; do not silently pick a different row.

1. Exact match.
2. Slug-normalised match (spaces ↔ `_` / `-`, case-insensitive where helpful).
3. Substring match only when 1–2 fail **and** one row clearly wins.

If ambiguous or no match, **stop**. In standalone mode, use **AskQuestion** so the **developer** picks item **N**, or they fix parent list / child `name:`. In spawned mode, return `partial` with `remainingTasks` naming the row/link mismatch; do not ask the developer from this child lane unless the upstream agent explicitly delegated that choice.

Capture **N**, the **Single concern** sub-bullet (proto-§ 1), and the **Plan** line (link or **`_TBD`** placeholder until **`new-plan`** / **`plan-reconcile`** wires it).

Verify that the captured **Plan** line links to this target plan after **`new-plan`** wiring. If it is still `_TBD`, points to another file, or is missing, continue drafting only if the body is otherwise valid, but report `parentPlanLinkStatus: "blocked"` and add a `remainingTasks` item for **`plan-reconcile`**. Do not report terminal readiness while the parent link is untrusted.

Acknowledge: *"Parent `### PR list` item N=<n>: \"<slug>\" — single concern captured."*

### 3b — Load `### Single-concern strategy` and `### Sequencing`

These ground § 4 **Why this approach** and **Considered & rejected**: split rationale, ordering vs sibling PRs, and explicit sequencing constraints.

### 3c — Load architectural / changes context

- **Master Plan parent:** § 4 Architectural design + § 5 Changes (including **`### Decomposition assessment`** when present).
- **Phase plan parent:** § 2 Scope + § 3 Code design + § 4 Changes.

Use diagrams and lists as **input** to prose; do **not** paste parent Mermaid into the PR plan body. § 3 Change scope stays short bullets only.

Acknowledge one line with what you loaded (diagram count, change bullet count).

## Step 4 — Draft §§ 1–4 into the target plan

### 4a — Write the body (fresh stub case)

When the body is the **new-plan** stub, replace the **entire body** in one `StrReplace` with the per-PR template through §§ 1–4 and **`_TBD_`** for §§ 5–8 (match **development-process.md** § 3 per-PR headings). Use this shape (fill `<…>` from steps 3–4b–4e; keep `**Status:** drafted` date from the agent clock):

````
old_string:
# <display name>

## Overview

<existing overview content>

## Phasing

<existing phasing stub>

## Out of scope

<existing out-of-scope stub>

new_string:
# <display name>

## 1. Single concern

<one sentence per § 4b>

## 2. Background

<2–3 sentences per § 4c>

## 3. Change scope

<short bullets per § 4d>

## 4. Reasoning

### Why this approach

<full sentences per § 4e>

### Considered & rejected

<_TBD_ or entries per § 4e>

## 5. Repo rules impact

_TBD_

## 6. Tests to write

_TBD_

## 7. Deploy test plan

**Status:** drafted *(<YYYY-MM-DD>: PR plan drafted.)*

### Before deploy

_TBD — numbered GFM task list (`1. [ ]` / `2. [ ]` / `3. [ ]`), not dashes, not bare numbers without checkboxes._

### After deploy

_TBD — numbered GFM task list (`1. [ ]` / `2. [ ]` / `3. [ ]`), not dashes, not bare numbers without checkboxes._

## 8. Caveats (optional)

_TBD_
````

Frontmatter **`name`**, **`overview`**, **`isProject`** stay as **`new-plan`** set them. If you ever edit a frontmatter scalar containing `: `, follow [`new-plan/SKILL.md`](../new-plan/SKILL.md) YAML quoting rules.

**Partial bodies:** one `StrReplace` per still-`_TBD_` §, anchored on section headers; do not wipe drafted text.

After the body first matches the per-PR template shape, run **§ 4a-bis** if `deploy-test-plan-verified` is not yet in frontmatter.

### 4b — § 1 Single concern

One sentence. Default: copy or lightly tighten the parent's **Single concern** sub-bullet for item **N**. Keep concrete, active voice, single purpose (Strategy #6).

### 4c — § 2 Background

Two or three sentences: prior state → gap or trigger → optional narrow context for **a reviewer agent**. Do **not** restate the whole feature; the parent file holds breadth.

### 4d — § 3 Change scope

Short bullets (**2–5 words** per bullet per dev-process). PR-scoped subset of parent's change list; split shared bullets across PRs; **flag** parent bullets that fit no PR boundary.

### 4e — § 4 Reasoning

Full sentences (not the short-bullet rule).

**### Why this approach** — two to four entries typical: cross-PR split rationale from **`### Single-concern strategy`**, sequencing from **`### Sequencing`**, structural choices from parent's design + this PR's slice.

**### Considered & rejected** — alternatives with why rejected; use parent text when present. If parent context has nothing honest, leave **`_TBD_`** and **flag** for **`coding-session`**.

### 4f — Echo to chat

Echo §§ 1–4 with the same headers as the file. Surface flags (unmapped parent bullets, **`_TBD_`** in **Considered & rejected**).

### 4a-bis — Append canonical `deploy-test-plan-verified` todo

After **4a** (full stub → per-PR template **or** first time the body is recognised as per-PR template with `## 7. Deploy test plan`), read frontmatter. If `id: deploy-test-plan-verified` already exists, **skip**.

Otherwise append this list item **immediately before** `isProject:` (indentation: two spaces before `-`, four before `id` / `content` / `status`, six before each `>-` continuation line — match sibling todos):

```yaml
  - id: deploy-test-plan-verified
    content: >-
      Mark done only when every Before-deploy and After-deploy step is checked
      (`[x]`) and the deploy section `**Status:**` reads `done` (walk via `deploy-walk`,
      or edit manually). Independent of PR merge; run `plan-reconcile` protocol branch when you want
      reconcile/archive after merges.
    status: pending
```

**Byte-identical** `content: >-` text must match **development-process.md** § *Frontmatter capstone todo (`deploy-test-plan-verified`)* — if that doc block changes, update this skill in the same change set.

**`StrReplace` anchor:** last existing todo's `    status: …` line + newline + `isProject:` → reinsert that status line + newline + the YAML block above + newline + `isProject:`. Append only; do not remove executor todos.

Echo: *"Inserted frontmatter todo `deploy-test-plan-verified` (per development-process.md)."*

### What not to draft here

Do **not** fully author §§ 5–8 as final text in the same turn as **4a** unless the **developer** explicitly chose a **fill** option in step 5 — those sections are usually best filled in **`coding-session`** once code paths exist. **`pre-pr-review`** treats missing or **`_TBD_`** § 5 / § 7 as hard problems and § 6 as under-documentation risk when the skill is run with strict gates — leaving **`_TBD_`** after **4a** is expected.

## Step 5 — Resolve implementation readiness

After §§ 1–4 are drafted and the deploy capstone todo is present, compute readiness for implementation.

### 5a — Readiness checks

Set `readyForImplementation: true` only when all are true:

- Target body has populated §§ 1–4.
- `## 1. Single concern` is one clear concern.
- `## 3. Change scope` has at least one concrete PR-scoped bullet.
- `## 4. Reasoning` has **Why this approach** populated.
- Parent `### PR list` row is matched and the parent `Plan:` link points to this target plan.
- Frontmatter includes `deploy-test-plan-verified`.

Set `readyForImplementation: false` when any of those checks fail. Add each missing item to `remainingTasks`.

### 5b — Planning completeness

§§ 5–8 may remain `_TBD_` after this skill. That does **not** block **`readyForImplementation`** by itself — see **Handoff to `coding-session`** for the split between speculative sketches here and substantive §§ 5–8 work in **`coding-session`**.

**Two-layer readiness (do not conflate):**

| Layer | Where | What passes |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Planning handoff** | This skill → `outputs.readyForImplementation` | §§ 1–4 drafted, capstone todo, parent link (§5a). §§ 5–8 may stay `_TBD_`. |
| **Worktree gate** | **`coding-session`** § *Worktree-open gate* | Per-PR body has **no** `_TBD_` outside fenced code, unless the developer chooses **Start with incomplete plan (executive override)** or sends **`override incomplete plan`** in the message. |

`readyForImplementation: true` does **not** bypass **`plan-ws-completeness.mjs`** or authorize worktrees. The Squad Leader §8 ship ledger must keep `phase: not-started` until completeness passes or is overridden **and** **`coding-session`** reports `developerApprovedImplementation: true` (**`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/plan.mdc`** §7–§8). Agents that report “ready” here may still hit **`INCOMPLETE`** at worktree open — that is expected; point the developer to finish §§ 5–8, pre-fill sketches (option 2), or the **`coding-session`** override path.

However:

- If § 4 **Considered & rejected** is `_TBD_`, add a non-blocking `remainingTasks` note for `coding-session`.
- If parent link is blocked, keep `continuationStatus: "active"` until **`plan-reconcile`** repairs it or the upstream agent explicitly accepts the partial state.
- Do not start `coding-session`; report readiness only.

### 5c — Hand back with next-move options

End with:

1. A **`file://`** link to the target `.plan.md` under `.sedea/operations/.../plans/...`.
2. One-line summary: *Drafted per-PR §§ 1–4; implementation readiness: `<ready|not ready>`; §§ 5–8 remain **`_TBD_`** for **`coding-session`** unless you request a fill sketch.*
3. **Numbered options** (adapt labels):

   1. **Revise § *N*** — The **developer** names the section and feedback; one focused `StrReplace`; echo.
   2. **Pre-fill § 5 / § 6 / § 7 / § 8 (sketch)** — Draft a *starting* sketch from parent + § 3 context; label it speculative; § 7 must use numbered GFM **`1. [ ]`** lists and **`**Status:** drafted`** opener; apply **`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/docs/development-process.md`** § 7 *What NOT to include* and the italic fallback when empty. After accepting a § 7 sketch, run **4a-bis** if the capstone todo is still missing.
   3. **Commit when ready** — Remind the **developer** to commit; this skill does **not** run `git`.
   4. **Continue in `coding-session`** — Layer 1 only: sets planning handoff intent (`readyForImplementation` when checks pass). Opens a **separate** **`coding-session`** run; layer 2 is one worktree-open **AskQuestion** there (**Start implementation now** or **Start with incomplete plan (executive override)**) → `outputs.developerApprovedImplementation`. See **`coding-session`** § *Implementation consent (two layers)*.

**Stop** after this block — do not spawn or run **`coding-session`** on this lane.

## Step 5a — Follow-up turns

On revise requests, re-read the section, `StrReplace`, echo, re-offer the step 5 menu.

On **fill** requests for § 5–8, draft the requested section with explicit *sketch* caveats; offer revise or accept; executor still owns final polish. After any fill, recompute implementation readiness and update the result contract.

## One primary choice per turn — surface observations

Perform exactly what was chosen. List short **numbered observations** for gaps (parent list mismatch, thin **Considered & rejected**, heavy § 3). No typed flag-control vocabulary.

## Scope guard

**Owns:** target PR plan **body** §§ 1–4; **4a-bis** append-only capstone todo; implementation readiness assessment; optional **fill** sketches for § 5–8 when explicitly chosen.

**Out of scope:** parent **`### PR list`** edits; parent **`Plan:`** wiring (**`plan-reconcile`**); frontmatter `name` / `overview` / `isProject` (except **4a-bis** append); **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** for **`coding-session`**; running **`coding-session`** on this lane; worktrees; `git`; Master / Phase templates (**`master-plan`**, **`phase-plan`**).

Stop after the step 5 handoff block.

## Completion (spawned)

### Host protocol line (required)

Emit **exactly one** line on its own: `AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1` immediately followed by a single JSON object on the **same** line. Required keys: `version` (1), `correlationId` (from the spawn request), `status`, `summary`, `outputs`, `errors` (use `[]` when none). Populate `outputs` from the list below. The emitted line must be **valid JSON** (no `{...}` placeholders in the actual output). Re-emit an **updated** line after user-requested follow-up on this lane (same `correlationId`). See **`.sedea/centers/sedea/skills/README.md`** § *Spawned terminal line*.

Required `outputs` fields:

- `outputs.targetPlanPath`, `outputs.targetPlanSlug`
- `outputs.parentPlanPath`, `outputs.parentPlanSlug`, `outputs.parentIndex`
- `outputs.parentPlanLinkStatus` — `linked` | `blocked` | `unknown`
- `outputs.readyForImplementation`, `outputs.implementationReadinessReasons`
- `outputs.implementationHandoffStatus` — `not-offered` | `offered` | `continue-to-coding-session` (step 5c option 4 chosen); planning menu only — not `developerApprovedImplementation`
- `outputs.activeLanes`, `outputs.openLedgerEntries`, `outputs.remainingTasks`
- `outputs.continuationOwner`: `"pr-plan-agent"`
- `outputs.continuationStatus`:
  - `terminal` when `readyForImplementation: true`, parent link is trusted, handoff menu is complete (or out of scope), and no blocking `remainingTasks`
  - `active` when parent link repair, fill sketches, or implementation handoff decision remains
  - `terminal` with `readyForImplementation: false` only when upstream or developer marks the PR plan deferred, abandoned, or out of scope

Stop after the terminal line. Do not spawn **`coding-session`** from this skill.

## Completion (inline)

Report the fields below in prose to the invoker on the **same lane**. Do **not** emit `AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`, `AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1`, or `MC_DISPATCH_RESOLVED_V1`. Do **not** add a **Host protocol line** under this section (see **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/4_mission.mdc`** § *Inline completion* and **`.sedea/centers/sedea/skills/README.md`** § *Completion (inline)*).

Spawned from **`new-plan`** or decomposition paths in normal flow. If run inline, use the same `outputs` semantics as **`## Completion (spawned)`** in prose only.
