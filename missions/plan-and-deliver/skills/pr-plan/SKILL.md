# PR plan: §§ 1–4 from the parent plan

**Normative execution (plan and deliver):** **Inline only** on the invoker lane — **`new-plan`** step 4 with **`parentAgentRole: "new-plan-agent"`**. Report **`## Completion (inline)`**; do **not** emit **`AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1`** for **`pr-plan`**. **Exception:** §5d may emit **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** for **`coding-session`** on a **new** child lane. A standalone spawned **`pr-plan`** child is non-default. See **`../README.md`** § *Normative execution mode*.

This skill drives the **per-PR planning move** under Sedea's New Feature Development Process: take a freshly-spawned PR plan stub (indexed child from the parent's **`### PR list`** under **`PR breakdown`**, typically right after the **`new-plan`** protocol branch) and populate §§ **1–4** of the **per-PR template** — Single concern, Background, Change scope, Reasoning. §§ **5–8** and the § 7 deploy scaffold stay **`_TBD_`** for **`coding-session`** and later turns unless the **developer** explicitly asks for a **fill** sketch here.

The agent has enough context after step 3 to draft §§ 1–4 from the parent's **`### PR list`** row, **`### Single-concern strategy`**, **`### Sequencing`**, and earlier parent sections (diagrams / changes as *context* — PR plans do **not** embed parent diagrams in the body). § 4 is consumed by **a coding agent** (PR description) and **pre-pr-review** / **a reviewer agent**; keep sentences unambiguous. This skill reports planning readiness; **worktrees and ship execution** belong to **`coding-session`** on a **separate** lane.

The procedure below is a hard contract — do **not** skip steps or start drafting before the target is verified as a PR plan stub.

**Worktree removal ownership (binding).** This skill populates plans only — **do not remove worktrees you do not own.** Worktree create/remove belongs to **`coding-session`** after §5d handoff. **`git worktree list` is read-only** unless rule **0** § *Worktree ownership* preconditions hold. See [`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/0_hosting-repo.mdc`](.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/0_hosting-repo.mdc) § *Worktree ownership*.

## Warm-up manifest (spawned)

Per [`.sedea/centers/sedea/docs/lane-manifest-contract.md`](.sedea/centers/sedea/docs/lane-manifest-contract.md) and **`../README.md`** § *Default warm-up*. Normative **inline** on invoker lane; manifest applies when standalone spawned or warm-up replay. Host merge: `effectiveWarmUp = dedupe(bootstrapRules → laneRules → skillWarmUp)`. **No `alwaysApply` frontmatter flip.**

## Handoff to `coding-session` (spawned child lane)

**`pr-plan`** and **`coding-session`** are **sequential skills on different lanes**. After planning handoff approval, **`pr-plan`** emits **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** for **`coding-session`**; the child owns worktrees, workspace attach, and **implements** the PR plan on that lane (default **spawned implementation lane** — see **`coding-session`** § *Execution mode after worktree attach*). When **`pr-plan`** runs **inline under `new-plan`**, §5d still spawns **`coding-session`** from the **`new-plan`** lane — only the **`pr-plan`** populator lane is eliminated.

| Concern | **`pr-plan`** (this skill) | **`coding-session`** |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Per-PR §§ **1–4** | Draft and maintain | Read; revise only when the developer returns to planning |
| Per-PR §§ **5–8** | Default **`_TBD_`**; optional *speculative* sketch if the developer picks a fill option | Substantive fill during implementation; final text once code paths are known |
| `readyForImplementation` | Set in `outputs` and passed in spawn `inputs` | Read as layer-1 hint only |
| Worktrees, implementation, ship chain | Out of scope — spawn only | Owns (spawned-lane default) |
| Start **`coding-session`** | Step **5d** after **AskQuestion** **Start coding session** (§5c) when §5a passes | Spawned child lane with `planningHandoffMode` + `planningHandoffApproved`; layer 2 **auto-authorizes** when §§1–4 drafted (or plan complete) — no second worktree-open modal |

**Signals (canonical):** **`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/rules/30_planning-target-resolution.mdc`** § *Planning readiness vs ship* and § *Agent checklist (planning vs ship — do not conflate)* — `readyForImplementation` on this lane does **not** authorize code edits, worktrees, commit/push, or §8 `phase` past `not-started`.

**Detached entry still valid:** The developer may still start **`coding-session`** via a new Mission Control session, natural language, or snapshot per **development-process.md** § *Start implementation (`coding-session` entry)* — without a **`pr-plan`** spawn.

## Trigger

- Mission dispatch or explicit request to run the **`pr-plan`** protocol branch.
- Natural language: draft PR plan, populate PR plan body, fill per-PR §§ 1–4.
- Immediately after **`new-plan`** ignition when the parent dual-title is **`PR breakdown`** — the usual next step on the new child stub.

The **developer** picks the next move per **30_planning-target-resolution** § *Sedea input channel*.

## Step 1 — Identify the target plan and verify it's a PR plan stub

The skill operates on a **target** `.plan.md` resolved before this skill runs, per [`30_planning-target-resolution.mdc`](../../../../rules/30_planning-target-resolution.mdc) § *Resolution order*. Acknowledge the target slug in one line when this skill starts. Resolve targets from session, snapshot, or explicit path — **planning-target-resolution** is normative. Do **not** infer the target from the IDE’s focused-file list alone.

When spawned by `new-plan` with `parentAgentRole: "new-plan-agent"`, run **inline** on the **`new-plan`** lane: report **`## Completion (inline)`** to the invoker — do **not** emit **`AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1`**. You may still emit **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** for **`coding-session`** per §5d.

When spawned by `new-plan` without `parentAgentRole: "new-plan-agent"` (legacy standalone populator spawn), `targetPlanPath`, `targetPlanSlug`, `parentPlanPath`, `parentPlanSlug`, and `parentIndex` are already locked. Treat missing or conflicting values as a spawn-contract failure: stop with `failure` or `partial` and report the missing field. Do not fall back to IDE focus or free-form target discovery in spawned mode.

If there is no resolved target, **stop** and emit a fresh *Where we are now in the plan tree* snapshot with **`AskQuestion`** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** in **one turn** per **30_planning-target-resolution** § *Sedea input channel* and **`../README.md`** § *Recap, structured choice, act* (`display.markdown` + `askQuestion`). **Obsolete:** recap-only turn without structured choice. Then continue.

Acknowledge in one line: *"Target plan: `<slug>`."*

### 1a — Verify the body's template state

Read the target plan in full and apply:

| Body state | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Has `## Overview` + `## Phasing` + `## Out of scope` (**new-plan** stub) | Fresh stub, drafting needed | Step 1b → Step 2 → Step 3 → Step 4 (full body rewrite) |
| Has `## 1. Single concern` … `## 4. Reasoning` with `_TBD_` under one or more of §§ 1–4 | Partially drafted | Step 1b → Step 2 → Step 3 → Step 4 (fill only still-`_TBD_` sections) |
| Has §§ 1–4 all populated | Already drafted | Step 5 (handoff menu) |
| Master Plan body (`## 4. Architectural design` + `## 6. Delivery phases \| PR breakdown`) | Wrong skill | **Stop:** use **`planner`**. |
| Phase plan body (`## 1. Background` … `## 4. Changes` for mode #2) | Wrong skill | **Stop:** use **`phase-planner`**. |

Acknowledge the body state in one line.

If the **new-plan** stub sections carry **non-stub user content**, merge it into § 2 / § 3 in your own words and **flag** that merge in the echo or handoff.

### 1b — Verify parent topology

Read the target plan's sidecar `<slug>.state.yaml` for `parent:`.

- `parent: null` (or sidecar missing) → **stop:** PR plans require a parent under **`PR breakdown`**. Fix via **`plan-reconcile`** or by hand, or use **`planner`** if this file should be a Master Plan.
- `parent:` does not resolve to an existing `.plan.md` under the same `.sedea/operations/.../plans/` tree → **stop:** fix sidecar before drafting.
- Parent is a **roadmap topic** grouping plan → **stop:** children should be Master Plans, not PR plans; fix sidecar or use **`planner`**.
- Parent resolves; read parent's dual-title block (`## 6. …` Master, `## 5. …` Phase):
 - Heading **`PR breakdown`** → proceed.
 - Heading **`Delivery phases`** → **stop:** use **`phase-planner`** on this file (phase child), not **`pr-plan`**.
 - Dual-title `Delivery phases | PR breakdown` still `_TBD_` → **stop:** run **`pr-breakdown`** (or **`delivery-phases`**) on the parent first.

Acknowledge: *"Parent: `<parent-slug>` (mode #3 **`PR breakdown`**); proceeding."*

If `parentPlanPath` / `parentPlanSlug` inputs were supplied, they must match the resolved sidecar parent and the parent file read here. If they conflict, stop with `failure`; the child was spawned against the wrong parent context.

## Step 2 — Load the development-process doc

Read `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/docs/development-process.md` with the Read tool, **no offset, no limit** (hosting repo root). Acknowledge: *"Loaded development-process.md; will follow § 3 per-PR template + § 6/§ 5 contents rule."*

Re-read every invocation; do not rely on session memory.

## Step 3 — Read the parent plan and find the PR row

Read the parent plan in full. Locate **`## 6. PR breakdown`** (Master parent) or **`## 5. PR breakdown`** (Phase parent). Inside: **`### Single-concern strategy`**, **`### Sequencing`**, **`### PR list`**.

### 3a — Match the target plan to a numbered item in `### PR list`

Match the target plan's `name:` to the **bolded slug** on a **`### PR list`** row. If spawned input includes `parentIndex`, inspect that exact item first and require it to match the target plan link or title; do not silently pick a different row.

1. Exact match.
2. Slug-normalised match (spaces ↔ `_` / `-`, case-insensitive where helpful).
3. Substring match only when 1–2 fail **and** one row clearly wins.

If ambiguous or no match, **stop**. In standalone mode, use **AskQuestion** so the **developer** picks item **N**, or they fix parent list / child `name:`. In spawned mode, return `partial` with `remainingTasks` naming the row/link mismatch; do not ask the developer from this child lane unless the upstream agent explicitly delegated that choice.

Capture **N**, the **Single concern** sub-bullet (proto-§ 1), and the **Plan** line (link or **`_TBD`** placeholder until **`new-plan`** / **`plan-reconcile`** wires it).

Verify that the captured **Plan** line links to this target plan after **`new-plan`** wiring. If it is still `_TBD`, points to another file, or is missing, continue drafting only if the body is otherwise valid, but report `parentPlanLinkStatus: "blocked"` and add a `remainingTasks` item for **`plan-reconcile`**. Do not report terminal readiness while the parent link is untrusted.

Acknowledge: *"Parent `### PR list` item N=<n>: \"<slug>\" — single concern captured."*

### 3b — Load `### Single-concern strategy` and `### Sequencing`

These ground § 4 **Why this approach** and **Considered & rejected**: split rationale, ordering vs sibling PRs, and explicit sequencing constraints.

### 3c — Load architectural / changes context

- **Master Plan parent:** § 4 Architectural design + § 5 Changes (including **`### Decomposition assessment`** when present).
- **Phase plan parent:** § 2 Scope + § 3 Code design + § 4 Changes.

Use diagrams and lists as **input** to prose; do **not** paste parent Mermaid into the PR plan body. § 3 Change scope stays short bullets only.

Acknowledge one line with what you loaded (diagram count, change bullet count).

## Step 4 — Draft §§ 1–4 into the target plan

### 4a — Write the body (fresh stub case)

When the body is the **new-plan** stub, replace the **entire body** in one `StrReplace` with the per-PR template through §§ 1–4 and **`_TBD_`** for §§ 5–8 (match **development-process.md** § 3 per-PR headings). Use this shape (fill `<…>` from steps 3–4b–4e; keep `**Status:** drafted` date from the agent clock):

````
old_string:
# <display name>

## Overview

<existing overview content>

## Phasing

<existing phasing stub>

## Out of scope

<existing out-of-scope stub>

new_string:
# <display name>

## 1. Single concern

<one sentence per § 4b>

## 2. Background

<2–3 sentences per § 4c>

## 3. Change scope

<short bullets per § 4d>

## 4. Reasoning

### Why this approach

<full sentences per § 4e>

### Considered & rejected

<_TBD_ or entries per § 4e>

## 5. Repo rules impact

_TBD_

## 6. Tests to write

_TBD_

## 7. Deploy test plan

**Status:** drafted *(<YYYY-MM-DD>: PR plan drafted.)*

### Local test

_TBD — numbered GFM task list (`1. [ ]` / `2. [ ]` / `3. [ ]`), not dashes, not bare numbers without checkboxes._

### Staging test

_TBD — numbered GFM task list (`1. [ ]` / `2. [ ]` / `3. [ ]`), not dashes, not bare numbers without checkboxes._

### After deploy

_TBD — numbered GFM task list (`1. [ ]` / `2. [ ]` / `3. [ ]`), not dashes, not bare numbers without checkboxes._

## 8. Caveats (optional)

_TBD_
````

Frontmatter **`name`**, **`overview`**, **`isProject`** stay as **`new-plan`** set them. If you ever edit a frontmatter scalar containing `: `, follow [`new-plan/SKILL.md`](../new-plan/SKILL.md) YAML quoting rules.

**Partial bodies:** one `StrReplace` per still-`_TBD_` §, anchored on section headers; do not wipe drafted text.

After the body first matches the per-PR template shape, run **§ 4a-bis** if `deploy-test-plan-verified` is not yet in frontmatter.

### 4b — § 1 Single concern

One sentence. When inline context or spawn **`inputs`** include **`parentRowSingleConcern`**, write **`## 1. Single concern`** to that string **verbatim** (trim outer whitespace only — **no** paraphrase, tighten, or rewrite). That field is the parent **`### PR list`** **Single concern** sub-bullet (PR description seed).

Otherwise: copy the parent's **Single concern** sub-bullet for item **N** without paraphrase when possible; only tighten when the source is ambiguous. Keep concrete, active voice, single purpose (Strategy #6).

### 4c — § 2 Background

Two or three sentences: prior state → gap or trigger → optional narrow context for **a reviewer agent**. Do **not** restate the whole feature; the parent file holds breadth.

### 4d — § 3 Change scope

Short bullets (**2–5 words** per bullet per dev-process). PR-scoped subset of parent's change list; split shared bullets across PRs; **flag** parent bullets that fit no PR boundary.

### 4e — § 4 Reasoning

Full sentences (not the short-bullet rule).

**### Why this approach** — two to four entries typical: cross-PR split rationale from **`### Single-concern strategy`**, sequencing from **`### Sequencing`**, structural choices from parent's design + this PR's slice.

**### Considered & rejected** — alternatives with why rejected; use parent text when present. If parent context has nothing honest, leave **`_TBD_`** and **flag** for **`coding-session`**.

### 4f — Echo to chat

Echo §§ 1–4 with the same headers as the file. Surface flags (unmapped parent bullets, **`_TBD_`** in **Considered & rejected**, thin reasoning) as numbered open items in **`display.markdown`** when multiple gaps exist before §5c; apply **Step 5-open-items — Open-item modal contract**. When only one minor flag exists, echo it in recap and proceed to §5a.

### 4a-bis — Append canonical `deploy-test-plan-verified` todo

After **4a** (full stub → per-PR template **or** first time the body is recognised as per-PR template with `## 7. Deploy test plan`), read frontmatter. If `id: deploy-test-plan-verified` already exists, **skip**.

Otherwise append this list item **immediately before** `isProject:` (indentation: two spaces before `-`, four before `id` / `content` / `status`, six before each `>-` continuation line — match sibling todos):

```yaml
 - id: deploy-test-plan-verified
 content: >-
 Mark done only when every Before-deploy and After-deploy step is checked
 (`[x]`) and the deploy section `**Status:**` reads `done` (walk via `deploy-walk`,
 or edit manually). Independent of PR merge; run `plan-reconcile` protocol branch when you want
 reconcile/archive after merges.
 status: pending
```

**Byte-identical** `content: >-` text must match **development-process.md** § *Frontmatter capstone todo (`deploy-test-plan-verified`)* — if that doc block changes, update this skill in the same change set.

**`StrReplace` anchor:** last existing todo's ` status: …` line + newline + `isProject:` → reinsert that status line + newline + the YAML block above + newline + `isProject:`. Append only; do not remove executor todos.

Echo: *"Inserted frontmatter todo `deploy-test-plan-verified` (per development-process.md)."*

### What not to draft here

Do **not** fully author §§ 5–8 as final text in the same turn as **4a** unless the **developer** explicitly chose a **fill** option in step 5 — those sections are usually best filled in **`coding-session`** once code paths exist. **`pre-pr-review`** treats missing or **`_TBD_`** § 5 / § 7 as hard problems and § 6 as under-documentation risk when the skill is run with strict gates — leaving **`_TBD_`** after **4a** is expected.

## Step 5 — Resolve implementation readiness

After §§ 1–4 are drafted and the deploy capstone todo is present, compute readiness for implementation.

### 5a — Readiness checks

Set `readyForImplementation: true` only when all are true:

- Target body has populated §§ 1–4.
- `## 1. Single concern` is one clear concern.
- `## 3. Change scope` has at least one concrete PR-scoped bullet.
- `## 4. Reasoning` has **Why this approach** populated.
- Parent `### PR list` row is matched and the parent `Plan:` link points to this target plan.
- Frontmatter includes `deploy-test-plan-verified`.

Set `readyForImplementation: false` when any of those checks fail. Add each missing item to `remainingTasks`.

### 5b — Planning completeness

§§ 5–8 may remain `_TBD_` after this skill. That does **not** block **`readyForImplementation`** by itself — see **Handoff to `coding-session`** for the split between speculative sketches here and substantive §§ 5–8 work in **`coding-session`**.

**Two-layer readiness (do not conflate):**

| Layer | Where | What passes |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Planning handoff** | This skill → `outputs.readyForImplementation` | §§ 1–4 drafted, capstone todo, parent link (§5a). §§ 5–8 may stay `_TBD_`. |
| **Worktree gate** | **`coding-session`** § *Auto-authorize implementation (pr-plan spawn)* when §5d passes `planningHandoffApproved` | Per-PR body may keep §§ 5–8 `_TBD_`; child lane opens worktree and implements without a second approval modal. Detached entry without spawn still uses the worktree-open gate. |

`readyForImplementation: true` does **not** bypass **`plan-ws-completeness.mjs`** or authorize worktrees on **this** lane. The Squad Leader §8 ship ledger must keep `phase: not-started` until **`coding-session`** reports `developerApprovedImplementation: true` (**`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/plan.mdc`** §7–§8). After §5d spawn, **`INCOMPLETE`** + **`EXPECTED_SECTIONS_5_8_TBD`** is **expected** — the child **auto-authorizes** worktrees when §§1–4 are drafted (no second modal). Detached **`coding-session`** still uses the worktree-open gate.

However:

- If § 4 **Considered & rejected** is `_TBD_`, add a non-blocking `remainingTasks` note for `coding-session`.
- If parent link is blocked, keep `continuationStatus: "active"` until **`plan-reconcile`** repairs it or the upstream agent explicitly accepts the partial state.
- Do not run worktrees or implementation on this lane; spawn **`coding-session`** only per §5d.

**`autoContinue` (frontmatter / spawn `inputs`):** Does **not** authorize skipping Step **5**, §5c, or auto-spawning **`coding-session`**. After §§1–4 are written, **always** run §5a → §5c on this lane (inline under **`new-plan`** or standalone). **`autoContinue: true`** only means readiness may be reported in **`outputs`** — implementation handoff still requires §5c **Start coding session** (or explicit **`defer`**) before §5d.

**Skip §5c on PR-breakdown auto-chain (binding):** When **`skipPrPlanHandoffModal: true`** (inline context from **`new-plan`** after **`pr-breakdown`** **`approve-list`** auto-expand of PR index **1**), after §5a passes run **`## Completion (inline)`** to the invoker with **`implementationHandoffStatus: not-offered`**, **`prPlanHandoffSkipped: true`**, and populated §§1–4 fields — **do not** open §5c on **this** inline **`pr-plan`** turn.

**`skipPrPlanHandoffModal` skips §5c on the inline pr-plan turn only** — it does **not** forbid **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** for **`coding-session`** from the invoker lane afterward.

| Invoker (`parentAgentRole`) | Who owns §5d-equivalent spawn or §5c re-entry |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **`new-plan-agent`** on **`planner`** lane | **This Master Plan child lane** owns §5c and §5d — inline **`pr-plan`** §5d **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** for **`coding-session`** emits from **the planner lane**, not the Squad Leader. **`planner`** Step **7b** may re-enter inline **`pr-plan`** §5c on the same **`targetPlanPath`**, or defer |
| **`new-plan-agent`** on **`phase-planner`** lane (`phase-planner-agent` subtree) | **`phase-planner/SKILL.md`** Step **5f** — offer spawn or **`reenter-pr-plan-5c`** on **that** child lane; **forbidden** to default to detached **`coding-session`** or **`planner`** prose redirect. **Decomposition** (inline **`pr-breakdown`** on **this phase plan**): Step **5b-decompose** on **`phase-planner`**, not **`planner`** Step **7**. |

When inline under **`phase-planner`**, include **`invokerRole: phase-planner-agent`** (or equivalent) in inline completion so the parent runs Step **5f** (implementation) or Step **5b-decompose** / **5e** (decomposition merge) without inferring from README shorthand alone.

**Forbidden after §§1–4 (binding — inline under `new-plan` or upstream on planner):**

- Report **`## Completion (inline)`** to the invoker while **`implementationHandoffStatus`** is still **`not-offered`** (§5c not yet shown) **unless** **`skipPrPlanHandoffModal: true`**.
- Bubble **`readyForImplementation: true`** upstream and return to **`planner`** Step **7b** master-plan menus without offering §5c on **this** lane first **unless** **`skipPrPlanHandoffModal: true`** (then include **`prPlanHandoffSkipped: true`** in inline completion).
- Skip §5c based on PRD **`operation: manage`** or a linked `@path` alone — PRD source does **not** change the **`pr-plan`** → **`coding-session`** handoff chain.

Set **`implementationHandoffStatus: "offered"`** when §5c modal is emitted; **`deferred`** when the developer picks **`defer`**; **`spawned-coding-session`** after §5d.

### Step 5-open-items — Open-item modal contract

Apply the shared planning open-item contract from `../README.md` § *Planning open-item modal contract* to every **pr-plan** gate that can surface multiple unresolved items before implementation handoff: §5a readiness blockers, blocked or untrusted parent `Plan:` links, unmapped parent change bullets, thin **Considered & rejected**, ambiguous row match, optional §5–8 pre-fill sketch choices, and non-blocking follow-up flags from step **4f**.

**When open items exist** — use **one modal with multiple `questions[]` entries**:

- **`display.markdown`:** numbered list of open items. For each item, include the PR plan section or parent row affected, the gap or blocker, why it matters for readiness or handoff, and the agent's proposed resolution options.
- **`askQuestion.questions`:** one scoped question per open item (for example `accept-scope-bullet`, `map-parent-bullet`, `defer-considered-rejected`, `repair-parent-link`, `prefill-section-N`, `mark-non-blocking`, `more-details`). **Forbidden:** one combined question whose options mix per-item resolutions with terminal handoff choices.
- **Final question:** always append the terminal **pr-plan** §5c handoff question last in the array (start coding session · revise section · pre-fill §§5–8 · defer · commit reminder · **More details for option _**). **Forbidden:** a resolve-only modal that omits §5c routing until every item is cleared — **except** when **`skipPrPlanHandoffModal: true`** (auto-chain only; inline completion without §5c).
- **Many open items:** batch across turns when needed; each batch still ends with the §5c terminal question unless **`skipPrPlanHandoffModal`** applies.

**When no open items remain** — use the existing single §5c terminal handoff question.

**Act after selection.** Apply each chosen item resolution, rewrite affected plan sections, re-run §5a readiness checks, then re-open the same modal shape until §5c can offer implementation handoff or defer.

### 5c — Hand back (recap + structured choice)

Per **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc`**, **`../README.md`** § *Planning open-item modal contract*, and **`../README.md`** § *Recap, structured choice, act (plan-and-deliver)*. Do **not** use “Turn A/B” labels in developer-facing chat.

Invoke **AskQuestion** or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** per **Step 5-open-items** — when readiness blockers or §4f flags remain, one scoped `questions[]` entry per open item, then the §5c terminal options table as the **final** `questions[]` entry.

**Preferred (one assistant message):** **AskQuestion tool** with brief recap, or **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** with:

- `display.markdown` — link + one-line readiness summary (below)
- `askQuestion` — modal (`modalTitle`: *PR plan — next move*; options from the table)

**Legacy split (obsolete on Mission Control lanes):** Prefer **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** (recap in `display.markdown` + `askQuestion` same turn). If the tool is unavailable, still **must** close with structured choice — do not end with recap-only prose.

#### Recap (same turn as structured choice)

When using the legacy split, do **not** include **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** or **`AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1`** in the recap message. Put recap content in **`display.markdown`** and **`askQuestion`** on the **same** turn per [`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc`](.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc) § **Turn completion invariant**. **Obsolete:** recap-only message with **AskQuestion** deferred to a separate turn.

1. A **`file://`** link to the target `.plan.md` under `.sedea/operations/.../plans/...`.
2. One-line summary: *Drafted per-PR §§ 1–4; implementation readiness: `<ready|not ready>`.*
3. Planning handoff note: *§§ **5–8** stay **`_TBD_`** until **`coding-session`** fills them on the implementation lane (or you choose **Pre-fill §§ 5–8 here (sketch, then coding)** below). Worktree validation may report **incomplete** — that is expected; the child lane **auto-starts** implementation when you pick **Start coding session** (no second approval modal) unless you pre-filled here or use detached entry.*

Do **not** echo the full §§ 1–4 body in chat unless the developer asked for a fill sketch in the same flow.

#### Structured choice — approval modal

Invoke **AskQuestion**, **`MC_PHASED_RESPONSE_V1`** (`modalTitle`: *PR plan — next move*) per **Step 5-open-items**. When using without a phased envelope, sentinel + JSON only — no prose before the sentinel. When open items exist, item-scoped questions precede the terminal handoff options below as the **last** `questions[]` entry:

Required options (brief `label`; put detail in `prompt` when needed):

| Option id | Label |
|-----------|--------|
| `start-coding-session` | Start coding session — fill §§5–8 there |
| `revise-section` | Revise a section |
| `prefill-sections` | Pre-fill §§5–8 here (sketch, then coding) |
| `commit-reminder` | Commit when ready |
| `defer` | Defer |
| `more-details` | More details for option _ |

- **`start-coding-session`** — Run §5d when §5a passes; if not ready, explain blockers in `remainingTasks` and do **not** spawn.
- **`revise-section`** — Developer names § *N* and feedback; one focused `StrReplace`; echo; re-offer §5c.
- **`prefill-sections`** — Same as former option 2 (speculative § 5–8 sketch); re-offer §5c.
- **`commit-reminder`** — Remind the developer to commit; this skill does **not** run `git`; re-offer §5c.
- **`defer`** — No spawn; set `implementationHandoffStatus: "deferred"` when reporting completion.

**Stop** after §5c AskQuestion or after §5d spawn announcement — do not run **`coding-session`** procedures on this lane.

**Inline under `new-plan`:** After §5c or §5d, report **`## Completion (inline)`** to the invoker — do **not** emit **`AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1`**. The **`new-plan`** lane merges ledger fields and aggregates **`coding-session`** child results per **`new-plan/SKILL.md`** step **5b**.

### 5d — Spawn `coding-session` (after `start-coding-session`)

Run only when the developer chose **`start-coding-session`** and §5a readiness passes. When §5a fails, stay on §5c — explain blockers in `remainingTasks` and do **not** spawn (§5c bullet above).

1. **Resolve paths** (all absolute; never documentation placeholders):
 - `targetPlanPath` — absolute path to the target `.plan.md` on this lane.
 - `targetPlanSlug` — slug from filename.
 - `parentPlanPath` / `parentPlanSlug` / `parentIndex` — from steps 1–3 when known.
 - `ledgerParent` — parent slug from sidecar `parent:` (not a placeholder string).
 - `repoPath` — walk up from `targetPlanPath` until **`.sedea/centers/sedea/`** exists; use the parent of **`.sedea/`** as hosting repo root.
2. **Build `initiatingPrompt`** — one short block with required bullets:
 - §1 single concern; §3 change-scope bullets; parent `### PR list` item **N**; `readyForImplementation` and §5a gaps; non-blocking `remainingTasks`.
 - `planningHandoffMode: sections-1-4-complete`
 - `sections5to8Status: TBD-by-design — child owns substantive fill; do not treat as pr-plan failure`
 - `expectedPlanCompleteness: incomplete-until-coding-session-fills-5-8 — auto-authorize worktree when EXPECTED_SECTIONS_5_8_TBD; no second approval modal`
 - `planningHandoffApproved: true` when `readyForImplementation: true` (layer 1 consent from §5c **Start coding session**)
3. **Emit exactly one** child-spawn line (valid JSON on the same line; new UUID per spawn):

 - Cross-check **`../README.md`** § *Universal spawn preflight* (including display-metadata rows **8–10**).
 - `skillPath`: `.sedea/centers/research-and-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/skills/coding-session/SKILL.md`
 - `name`: topic-specific label from §1 single concern or **`targetPlanSlug`** — **not** generic "Coding session" alone when a sharper label fits (≤64 chars)
 - `slug`: `coding-session-<targetPlanSlug>` (unique per dispatch)
 - `description`: one-line implementation scope (for example *Worktree and implementation for PR N …*)
 - `inputs`: `targetPlanPath`, `targetPlanSlug`, `readyForImplementation`, `planningHandoffApproved: true` (only when `readyForImplementation: true`), `planningHandoffMode: "sections-1-4-complete"` (required when `readyForImplementation: true`), `repoPath`, `ledgerParent`, `upstreamSkill: "pr-plan"`; include `parentPlanPath`, `parentPlanSlug`, `parentIndex` when known
 - Optional `warmUpRules`: merge **`.sedea/centers/research-and-development/rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc`** if not already loaded from skill frontmatter

4. Emit **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`**, announce waiting for the **`coding-session`** child result, and close the turn with structured choice per [`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc`](.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc) § **Turn completion invariant** — no second spawn in the same turn; do not prose-only stop.
5. Set `implementationHandoffStatus: "spawned-coding-session"` and record `spawnCorrelationId` matching the spawn request until the child terminal arrives.

### 5e — Aggregate `coding-session` child result

When Mission Control delivers **`AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1`** for the spawn `correlationId`:

1. Match by `correlationId` first, then `outputs.targetPlanPath` / `outputs.targetPlanSlug`.
2. Summarize for the developer: child status, whether worktrees were created, `developerApprovedImplementation`, `planCompleteness`, and `remainingTasks`.
3. Copy `outputs.activeLanes`, `outputs.openLedgerEntries`, and child `remainingTasks` into this lane's result when reporting upstream.
4. When child **`outputs.prShipComplete`** is **`true`**: merge **`shipPhase`**, **`rowStatus`**, **`mainPullStatus`**, **`archivedSlugs`**, and echo **`parentPlanPath`**, **`parentPlanSlug`**, **`parentIndex`** into this lane's **`outputs`**; set **`outputs.implementationHandoffStatus: "coding-session-terminal"`**; set **`outputs.codingSessionStatus`** from child **`status`**.
4a. When child **`outputs.parentPlanningFollowUpNotification`** is **`"sent"`** with non-empty **`parentPlanningFollowUps`**: copy into this lane's **`outputs`**; bubble upward on **re-emit updated** terminal (standalone) or **`## Completion (inline)`** (under **`new-plan`**) — **`coding-session`** does not schedule parent work; this lane does not expand PR lists.
5. **Re-emit updated terminal:** On a **standalone** spawned lane, emit a fresh **`AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1`** (same **`correlationId`**) with merged **`outputs`** including **`prShipComplete`**, **`parentPlanningFollowUps`** when present, and parent index fields — so **`new-plan`** / **`pr-breakdown`** / **`planner`** receive updates without manual **Ship recap**. **Inline under `new-plan`:** report merged fields in **`## Completion (inline)`** prose instead; the **`new-plan`** lane propagates per **`new-plan/SKILL.md`** step **5b**.
6. Do **not** treat child `developerApprovedImplementation: true` as permission to edit code on the **`pr-plan`** lane.
7. Re-offer §5c **AskQuestion** when the developer may revise the plan or spawn again after a failed/partial child run — unless **`prShipComplete: true`** and the developer defers follow-up on this lane (upstream owns **`expand-eligible`**).

## Step 5a — Follow-up turns

On revise requests, re-read the section, `StrReplace`, echo, re-offer the step 5c **AskQuestion** menu.

On **fill** requests for § 5–8, draft the requested section with explicit *sketch* caveats; offer revise or accept; executor still owns final polish. After any fill, recompute implementation readiness and update the result contract.

## One primary choice per turn — surface observations

Perform exactly what was chosen. List short **numbered observations** for gaps (parent list mismatch, thin **Considered & rejected**, heavy § 3, blocked parent link) in **`display.markdown`** and apply **Step 5-open-items — Open-item modal contract**: one scoped `questions[]` entry per observation, then the §5c terminal handoff question last. Prefer recap + modal in one message.

## Scope guard

**Owns:** target PR plan **body** §§ 1–4; **4a-bis** append-only capstone todo; implementation readiness assessment; optional **fill** sketches for § 5–8 when explicitly chosen.

**Out of scope:** parent **`### PR list`** edits; parent **`Plan:`** wiring (**`plan-reconcile`**); frontmatter `name` / `overview` / `isProject` (except **4a-bis** append); running **`coding-session`** procedures on this lane (worktrees, `git worktree`, MCP attach, implementation edits); Master / Phase templates (**`planner`**, **`phase-planner`**).

**In scope for spawn:** one **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** for **`coding-session`** per §5d after **AskQuestion** **`start-coding-session`** with real absolute paths (standalone spawned lane **or** inline under **`new-plan`**).

Stop after the step 5c **AskQuestion** turn, after §5d spawn announcement, or after §5e child summary — per terminal stop rules below. When **`parentAgentRole`** is **`new-plan-agent`**, skip **`AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1`** and report **`## Completion (inline)`** instead.

## Completion (spawned)

### Host protocol line (required)

Emit **exactly one** line on its own: `AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1` immediately followed by a single JSON object on the **same** line. Required keys: `version` (1), `correlationId` (from the spawn request), `status`, `summary`, `outputs`, `errors` (use `[]` when none). Populate `outputs` from the list below. The emitted line must be **valid JSON** (no `{...}` placeholders in the actual output). Re-emit an **updated** line after user-requested follow-up on this lane (same `correlationId`). See **`.sedea/centers/sedea/skills/README.md`** § *Spawned terminal line*.

Required `outputs` fields:

- `outputs.targetPlanPath`, `outputs.targetPlanSlug`
- `outputs.parentPlanPath`, `outputs.parentPlanSlug`, `outputs.parentIndex`
- `outputs.parentPlanLinkStatus` — `linked` | `blocked` | `unknown`
- `outputs.readyForImplementation`, `outputs.implementationReadinessReasons`
- `outputs.implementationHandoffStatus` — `not-offered` | `offered` | `deferred` | `spawned-coding-session` | `coding-session-terminal` (child finished); not `developerApprovedImplementation`
- `outputs.prPlanHandoffSkipped` — `true` when §5c was skipped via **`skipPrPlanHandoffModal`** (auto-chain from **`pr-breakdown`** **`approve-list`**)
- `outputs.spawnCorrelationId` — UUID from §5d when `implementationHandoffStatus` is `spawned-coding-session` or until child terminal is merged
- `outputs.codingSessionStatus` — echo child `status` when §5e applies
- `outputs.prShipComplete` — `true` when §5e merged child reconcile complete (archive + main pull)
- `outputs.parentPlanningFollowUpNotification`, `outputs.parentPlanningFollowUps` — when §5e merged child parent follow-up notification
- `outputs.mainPullStatus`, `outputs.archivedSlugs` — when §5e merged from child
- `outputs.shipPhase`, `outputs.rowStatus` — echo child when **`prShipComplete: true`**
- `outputs.activeLanes`, `outputs.openLedgerEntries`, `outputs.remainingTasks`
- `outputs.continuationOwner`: `"pr-plan-agent"`
- `outputs.continuationStatus`:
 - `terminal` when handoff menu is complete, no **`coding-session`** child is open, parent link is trusted, and no blocking `remainingTasks` (or developer deferred/abandoned)
 - `active` when parent link repair, fill sketches, **`coding-session`** child lane is open, or §5c menu not yet offered
 - `terminal` with `readyForImplementation: false` only when upstream or developer marks the PR plan deferred, abandoned, or out of scope

Complete §5d spawn (when chosen) + wait announcement **before** the terminal line when spawning on a **standalone** spawned lane. Stop after the terminal line. Do not emit a second **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** in the same turn after the terminal line (see **`../README.md`** § *Terminal stop (normative)*). **Inline under `new-plan`:** do **not** emit the terminal line — use **`## Completion (inline)`** below.

## Completion (inline)

Report the fields below in prose to the invoker on the **same lane**. Do **not** emit `AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1` for **`pr-plan`**, `AGENT_RESULT_RESPONSE_V1`, or `MC_DISPATCH_RESOLVED_V1`. Do **not** add a **Host protocol line** under this section (see **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/4_mission.mdc`** § *Inline completion* and **`.sedea/centers/sedea/skills/README.md`** § *Completion (inline)*). **Exception:** §5d may still emit **`AGENT_RUN_REQUEST_V1`** for **`coding-session`**.

**Primary path:** **`new-plan`** step 4 runs this skill **inline** (`parentAgentRole: "new-plan-agent"`). Use the same `outputs` semantics as **`## Completion (spawned)`** in prose only — the **`new-plan`** lane merges ledger fields and aggregates **`coding-session`** per **`new-plan/SKILL.md`** step **5b**. **Standalone** mission dispatch may still spawn this skill on a child lane; then use **`## Completion (spawned)`** instead.
